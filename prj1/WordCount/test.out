was, in fact, what happened. At 
the final moment, however, Amaranta did not feel frustrated, but on the contrary, free of all 
bitterness because death had awarded her the privilege of announcing itself several years ahead of 
time. She saw it on one burning afternoon sewing with her on the porch a short time after Meme 
had left for school. She saw it because it was a woman dressed in blue with long hair, with a sort of 
antiquated look, and with a certain resemblance to Pilar Ternera during the time when she had 
helped with the chores in the kitchen. Fernanda was present several times and did not see her, in 
spite of the fact that she was so real, so human, and on one occasion asked of Amaranta the favor of 
threading a needle. Death did not tell her when she was going to die or whether her hour was 
assigned before that of Rebeca, but ordered her to begin sewing her own shroud on the next sixth of 
April. She was authorized to make it as complicated and as fine as she wanted, but just as honestly 
executed as Rebeca’s, and she was told that she would die without pain, fear, or bitterness at dusk on 
the day that she finished it. Trying to waste the most time possible, Amaranta ordered some rough 
flax and spun the thread herself. She did it so carefully that the work alone took four years. Then she 
started the sewing. As she got closer to the unavoidable end she began to understand that only a 
miracle would allow her to prolong the work past Rebeca’s death, but the very concentration gave 
her the calmness that she needed to accept the idea of frustration. It was then that she understood 
the vicious circle of Colonel Aureliano Buendfa’s little gold fishes. The world was reduced to the 
surface of her skin and her inner self was safe from all bitterness. It pained her not to have had that 
revelation many years before when it had still been possible to purify memories and reconstmct the 
universe under a new light and evoke without trembling Pietro Crespi’s smell of lavender at dusk 
and rescue Rebeca from her slough of misery, not out of hatred or out of love but because of the 
measureless understanding of solitude. The hatred that she noticed one night in Memes words did 
not upset her because it was directed at her, but she felt the repetition of another adolescence that 
seemed as clean as hers must have seemed and that, however, was already tainted with rancor. But 
by then her acceptance of her fate was so deep that she was not even upset by the certainty that all 
possibilities of rectification were closed to her. Her only objective was to finish the shroud. Instead 
of slowing it down with useless detail as she had done in the beginning, she speeded up the work. 
One week before she calculated that she would take the last stitch on the night of February 4, and 
without revealing the motives, she suggested to Meme that she move up a clavichord concert that 


137 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


she had arranged for the day after, but the girl paid no attention to her. Amaranta then looked for a 
way to delay for forty-eight hours, and she even thought that death was giving her her way because 
on the night of February fourth a storm caused a breakdown at the power plant. But on the 
following day, at eight in the morning, she took the last stitch in the most beautiful piece of work 
that any woman had ever finished, and she announced without the least bit of dramatics that she 
was going to die at dusk. She not only told the family but the whole town, because Amaranta had 
conceived of the idea that she could make up for a life of meanness with one last favor to the world, 
and she thought that no one was in a better position to take letters to the dead. 

The news that Amaranta Buendia was sailing at dusk carrying the mail of death spread 
throughout Macondo before noon, and at three in the afternoon there was a whole carton full of 
letters in the parlor. Those who did not want to write gave Amaranta verbal messages, which she 
wrote down in a notebook with the name and date of death of the recipient. “Don’t worry,” she told 
the senders. “The first thing I’ll do when I get there is to ask for him and give him your message.” It 
was farcical. Amaranta did not show any upset or the slightest sign of grief, and she even looked a 
bit rejuvenated by a duty accomplished. She was as straight and as thin as ever. If it had not been for 
her hardened cheekbones and a few missing teeth, she would have looked much younger than she 
really was. She herself arranged for them to put the letters in a box sealed with pitch and told them 
to place it in her grave in a way best to protect it from the dampness. In the morning she had a 
carpenter called who took her measurements for the coffin as she stood in the parlor, as if it were 
for a new dress. She showed such vigor in her last hours that Fernanda thought she was making fun 
of everyone. Ursula, with the experience that Buendias died without any illness, did not doubt at all 
that Amaranta had received an omen of death, but in any case she was tormented by the fear that 
with the business of the letters and the anxiety of the senders for them to arrive quickly they would 
bury her alive in their confusion. So she set about clearing out the house, arguing with the intmders 
as she shouted at them, and by four in the afternoon she was successful. At that time Amaranta had 
finished dividing her things among the poor and had left on the severe coffin of unfinished boards 
only the change of clothing and the simple cloth slippers that she would wear in death. She did not 
neglect that precaution because she remembered that when Colonel Aureliano Buendia died they 
had to buy a pair of new shoes for him because all he had left were the bedroom slippers that he 
wore in the workshop. A little before five Aureliano Segundo came to fetch Meme for the concert 
and was surprised that the house was prepared for the funeral, if anyone seemed alive at the moment 
it was the serene Amaranta, who had even had enough time to cut her corns. Aureliano Segundo 
and Meme took leave of her with mocking farewells and promised her that on the following 
Saturday they would have a big resurrection party. Drawn by the public talk that Amaranta Buendia 
was receiving letters for the dead. Father Antonio Isabel arrived at five o’clock for the last rites and 
he had to wait for more than fifteen minutes for the recipient to come out of her bath. When he saw 
her appear in a madapollam nightshirt and with her hair loose over her shoulders, the decrepit parish 
priest thought that it was a trick and sent the altar boy away. He thought however, that he would 
take advantage of the occasion to have Amaranta confess after twenty years of reticence. Amaranta 
answered simply that she did not need spiritual help of any kind because her conscience was clean. 
Fernanda was scandalized. Without caring that people could hear her she asked herself aloud what 
horrible sin Amaranta had committed to make her prefer an impious death to the shame of 
confession. Thereupon Amaranta lay down and made Ursula give public testimony as to her 
virginity. 

“Let no one have any illusions,” she shouted so that Fernanda would hear her. “Amaranta 
Buendia is leaving this world just as she came into it. 

She did not get up again. Lying on cushions, as if she really were ill, she braided her long hair and 
rolled it about her ears as death had told her it should be on her bier. Then she asked Ursula for a 


138 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


mirror and for the first time in more than forty years she saw her face, devastated by age and 
martyrdom, and she was surprised at how much she resembled the mental image that she had of 
herself. Ursula understood by the silence in the bedroom that it had begun to grow dark. 

“Say good-bye to Fernanda,” she begged her. One minute of reconciliation is worth more than a 
whole life of friendship.” 

“It’s of no use now,” Amaranta replied. 

Meme could not help thinking about her when they turned on the lights on the improvised stage 
and she began the second part of the program. In the middle of the piece someone whispered the 
news in her ear and the session stopped. When he arrived home, Aureliano Segundo had to push his 
way through the crowd to see the corpse of the aged virgin, ugly and discolored, with the black 
bandage on her hand and wrapped in the magnificent shroud. She was laid out in the parlor beside 
the box of letters. 

Ursula did not get up again after the nine nights of mourning for Amaranta, Santa Sofia de la 
Piedad took care of her. She took her meals to her bedroom and annatto water for her to wash in 
and she kept her up to date on everything that happened in Macondo. Aureliano Segundo visited her 
frequently and he brought her clothing which she would place beside the bed along with the things 
most indispensable for daily life, so that in a short time she had built up a world within reach of her 
hand. She managed to arouse a great love in little Amaranta Ursula, who was just like her, and whom 
she taught how to read. Her lucidity, the ability to be sufficient un herself made one think that she 
was naturally conquered by the weight of her hundred years, but even though it was obvious that she 
was having trouble seeing, no one suspected that she was totally blind. She had so much time at her 
disposal then and so much interior silence to watch over the life of the house that she was the first 
to notice Meme’s silent tribulation. 

“Come here,” she told her. “Now that were alone, confess to this poor old woman what’s 
bothering you.” 

Meme avoided the conversation with a short laugh. Ursula did not insist, but she ended up 
confirming her suspicions when Meme did not come back to visit her. She knew that she was getting 
up earlier than usual, that she did not have a moment’s rest as she waited for the time for her to go 
out, that she spent whole nights walking back and forth in the adjoining bedroom, and that the 
fluttering of a butterfly would bother her. On one occasion she said that she was going to see Aureli¬ 
ano Segundo and Ursula was surprised that Fernanda’s imagination was so limited when her 
husband came to the house looking for his daughter. It was too obvious that Meme was involved in 
secret matters, in pressing matters, in repressed anxieties long before the night that Fernanda upset 
the house because she caught her kissing a man in the movies. 

Meme was so wrapped up in herself at that time that she accused Ursula of having told on her. 
Actually, she told on herself. For a long time she had been leaving a trail that would have awakened 
the most drowsy person and it took Fernanda so long to discover it because she too was befogged, 
by her relationship with the invisible doctors. Even so she finally noticed the deep silences, the 
sudden outbursts, the changes in mood, and the contradictions of her daughter. She set about on a 
disguised but implacable vigilance. She let her go out with her girl friends as always, she helped her 
get dressed for the Saturday parties, and she never asked an embarrassing question that might arouse 
her. She already had a great deal of proof that Meme was doing different things from what she said, 
and yet she would give no indication of her suspicions, hoping for the right moment. One night 
Meme said that she was going to the movies with her father. A short time later Fernanda heard the 
fireworks of the debauch and the unmistakable accordion of Aureliano Segundo from the direction 
of Petra Cotes’s place. Then she got dressed, went to the movie theater, and in the darkness of the 
seats she recognized her daughter. The upsetting feeling of certainty stopped her from seeing the 
man she was kissing, but she managed to hear his tremulous voice in the midst of the deafening 


139 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


shouts and laughter of the audience. “I’m sorry, love,” she heard him say, and she took Meme out of 
the place without saying a word to her, put her through the shame of parading her along the noisy 
Street of the Turks, and locked her up in her bedroom. 

On the following day at six in the afternoon, Fernanda recognized the voice of the man who 
came to call on her. He was young, sallow, with dark and melancholy eyes which would not have 
startled her so much if she had known the gypsies, and a dreamy air that to any woman with a heart 
less rigid would have been enough to make her understand her daughter’s motives. He was wearing 
a shabby linen suit with shoes that showed the desperate defense of superimposed patches of white 
zinc, and in his hand he was carrying a straw hat he had bought the Saturday before. In all of his life 
he could never have been as frightened as at that moment, but he had a dignity and presence that 
spared him from humiliation and a genuine elegance that was defeated only by tarnished hands and 
nails that had been shattered by rough work. Fernanda, however, needed only one look to guess his 
status of mechanic. She saw that he was wearing his one Sunday suit and that underneath his shirt he 
bore the rash of the banana company. She would not let him speak. She would not even let him 
come through the door, which a moment later she had to close because the house was filled with 
yellow butterflies. 

“Go away,” she told him. “You’ve got no reason to come calling on any decent person.” 

His name was Mauricio Babilonia. He had been born and raised in Macondo, and he was an 
apprentice mechanic in the banana company garage. Meme had met him by chance one afternoon 
when she went with Patricia Brown to get a car to take a drive through the groves. Since the 
chauffeur was sick they assigned him to take them and Meme was finally able to satisfy her desire to 
sit next to the driver and see what he did. Unlike the regular chauffeur, Mauricio Babilonia gave her 
a practical lesson. That was during the time that Meme was beginning to frequent Mr. Brown’s 
house and it was still considered improper for a lady to drive a car. So she was satisfied with the 
technical information and she did not see Mauricio Babilonia again for several months. Later on she 
would remember that during the drive her attention had been called to his masculine beauty, except 
for the coarseness of his hands, but that afterward she had mentioned to Patricia Brown that she 
had been bothered by his rather proud sense of security. The first Saturday that she went to the 
movies with her father she saw Mauricio Babilonia again, with his linen suit, sitting a few seats away 
from them, and she noticed that he was not paying much attention to the film in order to turn 
around and look at her. Meme was bothered by the vulgarity of that. Afterward Mauricio Babilonia 
came over to say hello to Aureliano Segundo and only then did Meme find out that they knew each 
other because he had worked in Aureliano Triste’s early power plant and he treated her father with 
the air of an employee. That fact relieved the dislike that his pride had caused in her. They had never 
been alone together nor had they spoken except in way of greeting, the night when she dreamed that 
he was saving her from a shipwreck and she did not feel gratitude but rage. It was as if she had given 
him the opportunity he was waiting for, since Meme yearned for just the opposite, not only with 
Mauricio Babilonia but with any other man who was interested in her. Therefore she was so 
indignant after the dream that instead of hating him, she felt an irresistible urge to see him. The 
anxiety became more intense during the course of the week and on Saturday it was so pressing that 
she had to make a great effort for Mauricio Babilonia not to notice that when he greeted her in the 
movies her heart was in her mouth. Dazed by a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, she gave him 
her hand for the first time and only then did Mauricio Babilonia let himself shake hers. Meme 
managed to repent her impulse in a fraction of a second but the repentance changed immediately 
into a cruel satisfaction on seeing that his hand too was sweaty and cold. That night she realized that 
she would not have a moment of rest until she showed Mauricio Babilonia the uselessness of his 
aspiration and she spent the week turning that anxiety about in her mind. She resorted to all kinds of 
useless tricks so that Patricia Brown would go get the car with her. Finally she made use of the 


140 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


American redhead who was spending his vacation in Macondo at that time and with the pretext of 
learning about new models of cars she had him take her to the garage. From the moment she saw 
him Meme let herself be deceived by herself and believed that what was really going on was that she 
could not bear the desire to be alone with Mauricio Babilonia, and she was made indignant by the 
certainty that he understood that when he saw her arrive. 

“I came to see the new models,” Meme said. 

“That’s a fine excuse,” he said. 

Meme realized that he was burning in the heat of his pride, and she desperately looked for a way 
to humiliate him. But he would not give her any time. “Don’t get upset,” he said to her in a low 
voice. “It’s not the first time that a woman has gone crazy over a man.” She felt so defeated that she 
left the garage without seeing the new models and she spent the night turning over in bed and 
weeping with indignation. The American redhead, who was really beginning to interest her, looked 
like a baby in diapers. It was then that she realized that the yellow butterflies preceded the 
appearances of Mauricio Babilonia. She had seen them before, especially over the garage, and she 
had thought that they were drawn by the smell of paint. Once she had seen them fluttering about 
her head before she went into the movies. But when Mauricio Babilonia began to pursue her like a 
ghost that only she could identify in the crowd, she understood that the butterflies had something to 
do with him. Mauricio Babilonia was always in the audience at the concerts, at the movies, at high 
mass, and she did not have to see him to know that he was there, because the butterflies were always 
there. Once Aureliano Segundo became so impatient with the suffocating fluttering that she felt the 
impulse to confide her secret to him as she had promised, but instinct told her that he would laugh 
as usual and say: “What would your mother say if she found out?” One morning, while she was 
pruning the roses, Fernanda let out a cry of fright and had Meme taken away from the spot where 
she was, which was the same place in the garden where Remedios the Beauty had gone up to 
heaven. She had thought for an instant that the miracle was going to be repeated with her daughter, 
because she had been bothered by a sudden flapping of wings. It was the butterflies. Meme saw 
them as if they had suddenly been born out of the light and her heart gave a turn. At that moment 
Mauricio Babilonia came in with a package that according to what he said, was a present from 
Patricia Brown. Meme swallowed her blush, absorbed her tribulation, and even managed a natural 
smile as she asked him the favor of leaving it on the railing because her hands were dirty from the 
garden. The only tiling that Fernanda noted in the man whom a few months later she was to expel 
from the house without remembering where she had seen him was the bilious texture of his skin. 

“He’s a very strange man,” Fernanda said. “You can see in his face that he’s going to die.” 

Meme thought that her mother had been impressed by the butterflies When they finished 
pruning the row bushes she washed her hands and took the package to her bedroom to open it. It 
was a kind of Chinese toy, made up of five concentric boxes, and in the last one there was a card 
laboriously inscribed by someone who could barely write: We’ll get together Saturday at the movies. Meme 
felt with an aftershock that the box had been on the railing for a long time within reach of 
Fernanda’s curiosity, and although she was flattered by the audacity and ingenuity of Mauricio 
Babilonia, she was moved by his Innocence in expecting that she would keep the date. Meme knew 
at that time that Aureliano Segundo had an appointment on Saturday night. Nevertheless, the fire of 
anxiety burned her so much during the course of the week that on Saturday she convinced her father 
to leave her alone in the theater and come back for her after the show. A nocturnal butterfly 
fluttered about her head while the lights were on. And then it happened. When the lights went out, 
Mauricio Babilonia sat down beside her. Meme felt herself splashing in a bog of hesitation from 
which she could only be rescued, as had occurred in her dreams, by that man smelling of grease 
whom she could barely see in the shadows. 

“If you hadn’t come,” he said, “You never would have seen me again.” 


141 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


Meme felt the weight of his hand on her knee and she knew that they were both arriving at the 
other side of abandonment at that instant. 

“What shocks me about you,” she said, smiling, “is that you always say exactly what you 
shouldn’t be saying.” 

She lost her mind over him. She could not sleep and she lost her appetite and sank so deeply into 
solitude that even her father became an annoyance. She worked out an intricate web of false dates to 
throw Fernanda off the track, lost sight of her girl friends, leaped over conventions to be with 
Mauricio Babilonia at any time and at any place. At first his crudeness bothered her. The first time 
that they were alone on the deserted fields behind the garage he pulled her mercilessly into an animal 
state that left her exhausted. It took her time to realize that it was also a form of tenderness and it 
was then that she lost her calm and lived only for him, upset by the desire to sink into his stupefying 
odor of grease washed off by lye. A short time before the death of Amaranta she suddenly stumbled 
into in open space of lucidity within the madness and she trembled before the uncertainty of the 
future. Then she heard about a woman who made predictions from cards and went to see her in 
secret. It was Pilar Ternera. As soon as Pilar saw her come in she was aware of Meme’s hidden 
motives. “Sit down,” she told her. “I don’t need cards to tell the future of a Buendia,” Meme did not 
know and never would that the centenarian witch was her great-grandmother. Nor would she have 
believed it after the aggressive realism with which she revealed to her that the anxiety of falling in 
love could not find repose except in bed. It was the same point of view as Mauricio Babilonia’s, but 
Meme resisted believing it because underneath it all she imagined that it had been inspired by the 
poor judgment of a mechanic. She thought then that love on one side was defeating love on the 
other, because it was characteristic of men to deny hunger once their appetites were satisfied. Pilar 
Ternera not only cleared up that mistake, she also offered the old canopied bed where she had 
conceived Arcadio, Meme’s grandfather, and where afterward she conceived Aureliano Jose. She 
also taught her how to avoid an unwanted conception by means of the evaporation of mustard 
plasters and gave her recipes for potions that in cases of trouble could expel “even the remorse of 
conscience.” That interview instilled In Meme the same feeling of bravery that she had felt on the 
dmnken evening. Amaranta’s death, however, obliged her to postpone the decision. While the nine 
nights lasted she did not once leave the side of Mauricio Babilonia, who mingled with the crowd that 
invaded the house. Then came the long period of mourning and the obligatory withdrawal and they 
separated for a time. Those were days of such inner agitation, such irrepressible anxiety, and so 
many repressed urges that on the first evening that Meme was able to get out she went straight to 
Pilar Ternera’s. She surrendered to Mauricio Babilonia, without resistance, without shyness, without 
formalities, and with a vocation that was so fluid and an intuition that was so wise that a more 
suspicious man than hers would have confused them with obvious experience. They made love 
twice a week for more than three months, protected by the innocent complicity of Aureliano 
Segundo, who believed without suspicion in his daughter’s alibis simply in order to set her free from 
her mother’s rigidity. 

On the night that Fernanda surprised them in the movies Aureliano Segundo felt weighted down 
by the burden of his conscience and he visited Meme in the bedroom where Fernanda kept her 
locked up, trusting that she would reveal to him the confidences that she owed him. But Meme 
denied everything. She was so sure of herself, so anchored in her solitude that Aureliano Segundo 
had the impression that no link existed between them anymore, that the comradeship and the 
complicity were nothing but an illusion of the past. He thought of speaking to Mauricio Babilonia, 
thinking that his authority as his former boss would make him desist from his plans, but Petra Cotes 
convinced him that it was a woman’s business, so he was left floating in a limbo of indecision, barely 
sustained by the hope that the confinement would put an end to his daughter’s troubles. 


142 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


Meme showed no signs of affliction. On the contrary, from the next room Ursula perceived the 
peaceful rhythm of her sleep, the serenity of her tasks, the order of her meals, and the good health 
of her digestion. The only thing that intrigued Ursula after almost two months of punishment was 
that Meme did not take a bath in the morning like everyone else, but at seven in the evening. Once 
she thought of warning her about the scorpions, but Meme was so distant, convinced that she had 
given her away, that she preferred not to disturb her with the impertinences, of a great-great- 
grandmother. The yellow butterflies would invade the house at dusk. Every night on her way back 
from her bath Meme would find a desperate Fernanda killing butterflies with an insecticide bomb. 
“This is terrible,” she would say, “All my life they told me that butterflies at night bring bad luck.” 
One night while Meme was in the bathroom, Fernanda went into her bedroom by chance and there 
were so many butterflies that she could scarcely breathe. She grabbed for the nearest piece of cloth 
to shoo them away and her heart froze with terror as she connected her daughter’s evening baths 
with the mustard plasters that rolled onto the floor. She did not wait for an opportune moment as 
she had the first time. On the following day she invited the new mayor to lunch. Like her, he had 
come down from the highlands, and she asked him to station a guard in the backyard because she 
had the impression that hens were being stolen. That night the guard brought down Mauricio 
Babilonia as he was lifting up the tiles to get into the bathroom where Meme was waiting for him, 
naked and trembling with love among the scorpions and butterflies as she had done almost every 
night for the past few months. A bullet lodged in his spinal column reduced him to his bed for the 
rest of his life. Fie died of old age in solitude, without a moan, without a protest, without a single 
moment of betrayal, tormented by memories and by the yellow butterflies, who did not give him a 
moment’s peace, and ostracized as a chicken thief.

Chapter 15 


THE EVENTS that would deal Macondo its fatal blow were just showing themselves when they 
brought Meme Buendia’s son home. The public situation was so uncertain then that no one had 
sufficient spirit to become involved with private scandals, so that Fernanda was able to count on an 
atmosphere that enabled her to keep the child hidden as if he had never existed. She had to take him 
in because the circumstances under which they brought him made rejection impossible. She had to 
tolerate him against her will for the rest of her life because at the moment of truth she lacked the 
courage to go through with her inner determination to drown him in the bathroom cistern. She 
locked him up in Colonel Aureliano Buendia’s old workshop. She succeeded in convincing Santa 
Sofia de la Piedad that she had found him floating in a basket. Ursula would die without ever 
knowing his origin. Little Amaranta Ursula, who went into the workshop once when Fernanda was 
feeding the child, also believed the version of the floating basket. Aureliano Segundo, having broken 
finally with his wife because of the irrational way in which she handled Meme’s tragedy, did not 
know of the existence of his grandson until three years after they brought him home, when the child 
escaped from captivity through an oversight on Fernanda’s part and appeared on the porch for a 
fraction of a second, naked, with matted hair, and with an impressive sex organ that was like a 
turkey’s wattles, as if he were not a human child but the encyclopedia definition of a cannibal. 

Fernanda had not counted on that nasty trick of her incorrigible fate. The child was like the 
return of a shame that she had thought exiled by her from the house forever. As soon as they carried 
off Mauricio Babilonia with his shattered spinal column, Fernanda had worked out the most minute 
details of a plan destined to wipe out all traces of the burden. Without consulting her husband, she 
packed her bags, put the three changes of clothing that her daughter would need into a small 
suitcase, and went to get her in her bedroom a half hour before the train arrived. 

“Let’s go, Renata,” she told her. 

She gave no explanation. Meme, for her part, did not expect or want any. She not only did not 
know where they were going, but it would have been the same to her if they had been taking her to 
the slaughterhouse. She had not spoken again nor would she do so for the rest of her life from the 
time that she heard the shot in the backyard and the simultaneous cry of pain from Mauricio 
Babilonia. When her mother ordered her out of the bedroom she did not comb her hair or wash her 
face and she got into the train as if she were walking in her sleep, not even noticing the yellow 
butterflies that were still accompanying her. Fernanda never found out nor did she take the trouble 
to, whether that stony silence was a determination of her will or whether she had become mute 
because of the impact of the tragedy. Meme barely took notice of the journey through the formerly 
enchanted region. She did not see the shady, endless banana groves on both sides of the tracks. She 
did not see the white houses of the gringos or their gardens, dried out by dust and heat, or the 
women in shorts and blue-striped shirts playing cards on the terraces. She did not see the oxcarts on 
the dusty roads loaded down with bunches of bananas. She did not see the girls diving into the 
transparent rivers like tarpons, leaving the passengers on the train with the bitterness of their 
splendid breasts, or the miserable huts of the workers all huddled together where Mauricio Babilo- 
nia’s yellow butterflies fluttered about and in the doorways of which there were green and squalid 
children sitting on their pots, and pregnant women who shouted insults at the train. That fleeting 
vision, which had been a celebration for her when she came home from school, passed through 
Meme’s heart without a quiver. She did not look out of the window, not even when the burning 
dampness of the groves ended and the train went through a poppy-laden plain where the carbonized 


144 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


skeleton of the Spanish galleon still sat and then came out into the dear air alongside the frothy, dirty 
sea where almost a century before Jose Arcadio Buendia’s illusions had met defeat. 

At five o’clock in the afternoon, when they had come to the last station in the swamp, she got 
out of the train because Fernanda made her. They got into a small carriage that looked like an 
enormous bat, drawn by an asthmatic horse, and they went through the desolate city in the endless 
streets of which, split by saltiness, there was the sound of a piano lesson just like the one that 
Fernanda heard during the siestas of her adolescence. They went on board a riverboat, the wooden 
wheel of which had a sound of conflagration, and whose msted metal plates reverberated like the 
mouth of an oven. Meme shut herself up in her cabin. Twice a day Fernanda left a plate of food by 
her bed and twice a day she took it away intact, not because Meme had resolved to die of hunger, 
but because even the smell of food was repugnant to her and her stomach rejected even water. Not 
even she herself knew that her fertility had outwitted the mustard vapors, just as Fernanda did not 
know until almost a year later, when they brought the child. In the suffocating cabin, maddened by 
the vibration of the metal plates and the unbearable stench of the mud stirred up by the paddle 
wheel, Meme lost track of the days. Much time had passed when she saw the last yellow butterfly 
destroyed in the blades of the fan and she admitted as an irremediable tmth that Mauricio Babilonia 
had died. She did not let herself be defeated by resignation, however. She kept on thinking about 
him during the arduous muleback crossing of the hallucinating plateau where Aureliano Segundo 
had become lost when he was looking for the most beautiful woman who had ever appeared on the 
face of the earth, and when they went over the mountains along Indian trails and entered the gloomy 
city in whose stone alleys the funereal bronze bells of thirty-two churches tolled. That night they 
slept in the abandoned colonial mansion on boards that Fernanda laid on the floor of a room 
invaded by weeds, wrapped in the shreds of curtains that they pulled off the windows and that fell to 
pieces with every turn of the body. Meme knew where they were because in the flight of her 
insomnia she saw pass by the gentleman dressed in black whom they delivered to the house inside a 
lead box on one distant Christmas Eve. On the following day, after mass, Fernanda took her to a 
somber building that Meme recognized immediately from her mother’s stories of the convent where 
they had raised her to be a queen, and then she understood that they had come to the end of the 
journey. While Fernanda was speaking to someone in the office next door, Meme remained in a 
parlor checkered with large oil paintings of colonial archbishops, still wearing an etamine dress with 
small black flowers and stiff high shoes which were swollen by the cold of the uplands. She was 
standing in the center of the parlor thinking about Mauricio Babilonia under the yellow stream of 
light from the stained glass windows when a very beautiful novice came out of the office carrying 
her suitcase with the three changes of clothing. As she passed Meme she took her hand without 
stopping. 

“Come, Renata,” she said to her. 

Meme took her hand and let herself be led. The last time that Fernanda saw her, trying to keep 
up with the novice, the iron grating of the cloister had just closed behind her. She was still thinking 
about Mauricio Babilonia, his smell of grease, and his halo of butterflies, and she would keep on 
thinking about him for all the days of her life until the remote autumn morning when she died of old 
age, with her name changed and her head shaved and without ever having spoken a word, in a 
gloomy hospital in Cracow. 

Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train protected by armed police. During the trip she noticed 
the tension of the passengers, the military preparations in the towns along the line, and an 
atmosphere rarified by the certainty that something serious was going to happen, but she had no 
information until she reached Macondo and they told her that Jose Arcadio Segundo was inciting 
the workers of the banana company to strike. “That’s all we need,” Fernanda said to herself. “An 
anarchist in the family.” The strike broke out two weeks later and it did not have the dramatic 


145 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


consequences that had been feared. The workers demanded that they not be obliged to cut and load 
bananas on Sundays, and the position seemed so just that even Father Antonio Isabel interceded in 
its favor because he found it in accordance with the laws of God. That victory, along with other 
actions that were initiated during the following months, drew the colorless Jose Arcadio Segundo 
out of his anonymity, for people had been accustomed to say that he was only good for filling up the 
town with French whores. With the same impulsive decision with which he had auctioned off his 
fighting cocks in order to organize a harebrained boat business, he gave up his position as foreman 
in the banana company and took the side of the workers. Quite soon he was pointed out as the 
agent of an international conspiracy against public order. One night, during the course of a week 
darkened by somber mmors, he miraculously escaped four revolver shots taken at him by an 
unknown party as he was leaving a secret meeting. The atmosphere of the following months was so 
tense that even Ursula perceived it in her dark corner, and she had the impression that once more 
she was living through the dangerous times when her son Aureliano carried the homeopathic pills of 
subversion in his pocket. She tried to speak to Jose Arcadio Segundo, to let him know about that 
precedent, but Aureliano Segundo told her that since the night of the attempt on his life no one 
knew his whereabouts. 

“Just like Aureliano,” Ursula exclaimed. “It’s as if the world were repeating itself.” 

Fernanda, was immune to the uncertainty of those days. She had no contact with the outside 
world since the violent altercation she had had with her husband over her having decided Memes 
fate without his consent. Aureliano Segundo was prepared to rescue his daughter with the help of 
the police if necessary, but Fernanda showed him some papers that were proof that she had entered 
the convent of her own free will. Meme had indeed signed once she was already behind the iron 
grating and she did it with the same indifference with which she had allowed herself to be led away. 
Underneath it all, Aureliano Segundo did not believe in the legitimacy of the proof. Just as he never 
believed that Mauricio Babilonia had gone into the yard to steal chickens, but both expedients 
served to ease his conscience, and thus he could go back without remorse under the shadow of Petra 
Cotes, where he revived his noisy revelry and unlimited gourmandizing. Foreign to the restlessness 
of the town, deaf to Ursula’s quiet predictions. Fernanda gave the last tarn to the screw of her 
preconceived plan. She wrote a long letter to her son Jose Arcadio, who was then about to take his 
first orders, and in it she told him that his sister Renata had expired in the peace of the Lord and as a 
consequence of the black vomit. Then she put Amaranta Ursula under the care of Santa Sofia de la 
Piedad and dedicated herself to organizing her correspondence with the invisible doctors, which had 
been upset by Meme’s trouble. The first thing that she did was to set a definite date for the 
postponed telepathic operation. But the invisible doctors answered her that it was not wise so long 
as the state of social agitation continued in Macondo. She was so urgent and so poorly Informed 
that she explained to them In another letter that there was no such state of agitation and that 
everything was the result of the lunacy of a brother-in-law of hers who was fiddling around at that 
time in that labor union nonsense just as he had been involved with cockfighting and riverboats 
before. They were still not in agreement on the hot Wednesday when an aged nun knocked at the 
door bearing a small basket on her arm. When she opened the door Santa Sofia de la Piedad thought 
that it was a gift and tried to take the small basket that was covered with a lovely lace wrap. But the 
nun stopped her because she had instmctions to give it personally and with the strictest secrecy to 
Dona Fernanda del Carpio de Buendia. It was Meme’s son. Fernanda’s former spiritual director 
explained to her in a letter that he had been born two months before and that they had taken the 
privilege of baptizing him Aureliano, for his grandfather, because his mother would not open her 
lips to tell them her wishes. Fernanda rose up inside against that trick of fate, but she had sufficient 
strength to hide it in front of the nun. 

“We’ll tell them that we found him floating in the basket,” she said smiling. 


146 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


“No one will believe it,” the nun said. 

“If they believe it in the Bible,” Fernanda replied, “I don’t see why they shouldn’t believe it from 
me.” 

The nun lunched at the house while she waited for the train back, and in accordance with the 
discretion they asked of her, she did not mention the child again, but Fernanda viewed her as an 
undesirable witness of her shame and lamented the fact that they had abandoned the medieval 
custom of hanging a messenger who bore bad news. It was then that she decided to drown the child 
in the cistern as soon as the nun left, but her heart was not strong enough and she preferred to wait 
patiendy until the infinite goodness of God would free her from the annoyance. 

The new Aureliano was a year old when the tension of the people broke with no forewarning. 
Jose Arcadio Segundo and other union leaders who had remained underground until then suddenly 
appeared one weekend and organized demonstrations in towns throughout the banana region. The 
police merely maintained public order. But on Monday night the leaders were taken from their 
homes and sent to jail in the capital of the province with two-pound irons on their legs. Taken 
among them were Jose Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilan, a colonel in the Mexican revolution, 
exiled in Macondo, who said that he had been witness to the heroism of his comrade Artemio Cruz. 
They were set free, however, within three months because of the fact that the government and the 
banana company could not reach an agreement as to who should feed them in jail. The protests of 
the workers this time were based on the lack of sanitary facilities in their living quarters, the 
nonexistence of medical services, and terrible working conditions. They stated, furthermore, that 
they were not being paid in real money but in scrip, which was good only to buy Virginia ham in the 
company commissaries. Jose Arcadio Segundo was put in jail because he revealed that the scrip 
system was a way for the company to finance its fruit ships; which without the commissary 
merchandise would have to return empty from New Orleans to the banana ports. The other 
complaints were common knowledge. The company physicians did not examine the sick but had 
them line up behind one another in the dispensaries and a nurse would put a pill the color of copper 
sulfate on their tongues, whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation. It was a cure that was 
so common that children would stand in line several times and instead of swallowing the pills would 
take them home to use as bingo markers. The company workers were crowded together in miserable 
barracks. The engineers, instead of putting in toilets, had a portable latrine for every fifty people 
brought to the camps at Christmas time and they held public demonstrations of how to use them so 
that they would last longer. The decrepit lawyers dressed in black who during other times had 
besieged Colonel Aureliano Buendia and who now were controlled by the banana company 
dismissed those demands with decisions that seemed like acts of magic. When the workers drew up 
a list of unanimous petitions, a long time passed before they were able to notify the banana company 
officially. As soon as he found out about the agreement Mr. Brown hitched his luxurious glassed-in 
coach to the train and disappeared from Macondo along with the more prominent representatives of 
his company. Nonetheless some workers found one of them the following Saturday in a brothel and 
they made him sign a copy of the sheet with the demands while he was naked with the women who 
had helped to entrap him. The mournful lawyers showed in court that that man had nothing to do 
with the company and in order that no one doubt their arguments they had him jailed as an 
impostor. Later on, Mr. Brown was surprised traveling incognito, in a third-class coach and they 
made him sign another copy of the demands. On the following day he appeared before the judges 
with his hair dyed black and speaking flawless Spanish. The lawyers showed that the man was not 
Mr. Jack Brown, the superintendent of the banana company, born in Prattville Alabama, but a 
harmless vendor of medicinal plants, born in Macondo and baptized there with the name of 
Dagoberto Fonseca. A while later, faced with a new attempt by the workers the lawyers publicly 
exhibited Mr. Brown’s death certificate, attested to by consuls and foreign ministers which bore 


147 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


witness that on June ninth last he had been run over by a fire engine in Chicago. Tired of that 
hermeneutical delirium, the workers turned away from the authorities in Macondo and brought their 
complaints up to the higher courts. It was there that the sleight-of-hand lawyers proved that the 
demands lacked all validity for the simple reason that the banana company did not have, never had 
had, and never would have any workers in its service because they were all hired on a temporary and 
occasional basis. So that the fable of the Virginia ham was nonsense, the same as that of the 
miraculous pills and the Yuletide toilets, and by a decision of the court it was established and set 
down in solemn decrees that the workers did not exist. 

The great strike broke out. Cultivation stopped halfway, the fruit rotted on the trees and the 
hundred-twenty-car trains remained on the sidings. The idle workers overflowed the towns. The 
Street of the Turks echoed with a Saturday that lasted for several days and in the poolroom at the 
Hotel Jacob they had to arrange twenty-four-hour shifts. That was where Jose Arcadio Segundo was 
on the day it was announced that the army had been assigned to reestablish public order. Although 
he was not a man given to omens, the news was like an announcement of death that he had been 
waiting for ever since that distant morning when Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had let him see an 
execution. The bad omen did not change his solemnity, however. He took the shot he had planned 
and it was good. A short time later the dmmbeats, the shrill of the bugle, the shouting and running 
of the people told him that not only had the game of pool come to an end, but also the silent and 
solitary game that he had been playing with himself ever since that dawn execution. Then he went 
out into the street and saw them. There were three regiments, whose march in time to a galley dmm 
made the earth tremble. Their snorting of a many-headed dragon filled the glow of noon with a 
pestilential vapor. They were short, stocky, and brutelike. They perspired with the sweat of a horse 
and had a smell of suntanned hide and the taciturn and impenetrable perseverance of men from the 
uplands. Although it took them over an hour to pass by, one might have thought that they were only 
a few squads marching in a circle, because they were all identical, sons of the same bitch, and with 
the same stolidity they all bore the weight of their packs and canteens, the shame of their rifles with 
fixed bayonets, and the chancre of blind obedience and a sense of honor. Ursula heard them pass 
from her bed in the shadows and she made a crow with her fingers. Santa Sofia de la Piedad existed 
for an instant, leaning over the embroidered tablecloth that she had just ironed, and she thought of 
her son, Jose Arcadio Segundo, who without changing expression watched the last soldiers pass by 
the door of the Hotel Jacob. 

Martial law enabled the army to assume the functions of arbitrator in the controversy, but no 
effort at conciliation was made. As soon as they appeared in Macondo, the soldiers put aside their 
rifles and cut and loaded the bananas and started the trains mnning. The workers, who had been 
content to wait until then, went into the woods with no other weapons but their working machetes 
and they began to sabotage the sabotage. They burned plantations and commissaries, tore up tracks 
to impede the passage of the trains that began to open their path with machine-gun fire, and they cut 
telegraph and telephone wires. The irrigation ditches were stained with blood. Mr. Brown, who was 
alive in the electrified chicken coop, was taken out of Macondo with his family and those of his 
fellow countrymen and brought to a safe place under the protection of the army. The situation was 
threatening to lead to a bloody and unequal civil war when the authorities called upon the workers 
to gather in Macondo. The summons announced that the civil and military leader of the province 
would arrive on the following Friday ready to intercede in the conflict. 

Jose Arcadio Segundo was in the crowd that had gathered at the station on Friday since early in 
the morning. He had taken part in a meeting of union leaders and had been commissioned, along 
with Colonel Gavilan, to mingle in the crowd and orient it according to how things went. He did not 
feel well and a salty paste was beginning to collect on his palate when he noticed that the army had 
set up machine-gun emplacements around the small square and that the wired city of the banana 


148 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


company was protected by artillery pieces. Around twelve o’clock, waiting for a train that was not 
arriving, more than three thousand people, workers, women, and children, had spilled out of the 
open space in front of the station and were pressing into the neighboring streets, which the army 
had closed off with rows of machine guns. At that time it all seemed more like a jubilant fair than a 
waiting crowd. They had brought over the fritter and drink stands from the Street of the Turks and 
the people were in good spirits as they bore the tedium of waiting and the scorching sun. A short 
time before three o’clock the mmor spread that the official train would not arrive until the following 
day. The crowd let out a sigh of disappointment. An army lieutenant then climbed up onto the roof 
of the station where there were four machine-gun emplacements aiming at the crowd and called for 
silence. Next to Jose Arcadio Segundo there was a barefooted woman, very fat, with two children 
between the ages of four and seven. She was carrying the smaller one and she asked Jose Arcadio 
Segundo, without knowing him, if he would lift up the other one so that he could hear better. Jose 
Arcadio Segundo put the child on his shoulders. Many years later that child would still tell, to the 
disbelief of all, that he had seen the lieutenant reading Decree No. 4 of the civil and military leader 
of the province through an old phonograph horn. It had been signed by General Carlos Cortes 
Vargas and his secretary. Major Enrique Garcia Isaza, and in three articles of eighty words he 
declared the strikers to be a “bunch of hoodlums” and he authorized the army to shoot to kill. 

After the decree was read, in the midst of a deafening hoot of protest, a captain took the place of 
the lieutenant on the roof of the station and with the horn he signaled that he wanted to speak. The 
crowd was quiet again. 

“Ladies and gentlemen,” the captain said in a low voice that was slow and a little tired, “you have 
five minutes to withdraw.” 

The redoubled hooting and shouting drowned out the bugle call that announced the start of the 
count. No one moved. 

Five minutes have passed,” the captain said in the same tone. “One more minute and we’ll open 
fire.” 

Jose Arcadio Segundo, sweating ice, lowered the child and gave him to the woman. “Those 
bastards might just shoot,” she murmured. Jose Arcadio Segundo did not have time to speak 
because at that instant he recognized the hoarse voice of Colonel Gavilan echoing the words of the 
woman with a shout. Intoxicated by the tension, by the miraculous depth of the silence, and 
furthermore convinced that nothing could move that crowd held tight in a fascination with death, 
Jose Arcadio Segundo raised himself up over the heads in front of him and for the first time in his 
life he raised his voice. 

“You bastards!” he shouted. “Take the extra minute and stick it up your ass!” 

After his shout something happened that did not bring on fright but a kind of hallucination. The 
captain gave the order to fire and fourteen machine guns answered at once. But it all seemed like a 
farce. It was as if the machine guns had been loaded with caps, because their panting rattle could be 
heard and their incandescent spitting could be seen, but not the slightest reaction was perceived, not 
a cry, not even a sigh among the compact crowd that seemed petrified by an instantaneous 
invulnerability. Suddenly, on one side-of the station, a cry of death tore open the enchantment: 
“Aaaagh, Mother.” A seismic voice, a volcanic breath, the roar of a cataclysm broke out in the center 
of the crowd with a great potential of expansion. Jose Arcadio Segundo barely had time to pick up 
the child while the mother with the other one was swallowed up by the crowd that swirled about in 
panic. 

Many years later that child would still tell, in spite of people thinking that he was a crazy old man, 
how Jose Arcadio Segundo had lifted him over his head and hauled him, almost in the air, as if 
floating on the terror of the crowd, toward a nearby street. The child’s privileged position allowed 


149 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


him to see at that moment that the wild mass was starting to get to the comer and the row of 
machine guns opened fire. Several voices shouted at the same time: 

“Get down! Get down!” 

The people in front had already done so, swept down by the wave of bullets. The survivors, 
instead of getting down, tried to go back to the small square, and the panic became a dragon’s tail as 
one compact wave ran against another which was moving in the opposite direction, toward the 
other dragon’s tail In the street across the way, where the machine guns were also firing without 
cease. They were Penned in. swirling about in a gigantic whirlwind that little by little was being 
reduced to its epicenter as the edges were systematically being cut off all around like an onion being 
peeled by the insatiable and methodical shears of the machine guns. The child saw a woman 
kneeling with her arms in the shape of a cross in an open space, mysteriously free of the stampede. 
Jose Arcadio Segundo put him up there at the moment he fell with his face bathed in blood, before 
the colossal troop wiped out the empty space, the kneeling woman, the light of the high, drought- 
stricken sky, and the whorish world where Ursula Iguaran had sold so many little candy animals. 

When Jose Arcadio Segundo came to he was lying face up in the darkness. He realized that he 
was riding on an endless and silent train and that his head was caked with dry blood and that all his 
bones ached. He felt an intolerable desire to sleep. Prepared to sleep for many hours, safe from the 
terror and the horror, he made himself comfortable on the side that pained him less, and only then 
did he discover that he was lying against dead people. There was no free space in the car except for 
an aisle in the middle. Several hours must have passed since the massacre because the corpses had 
the same temperature as a plaster in autumn and the same consistency of petrified foam that it had, 
and those who had put them in the car had had time to pile them up in the same way in which they 
transported bunches of bananas. Trying to flee from the nightmare, Jose Arcadio Segundo dragged 
himself from one car to an other in the direction in which the train was heading, and in the flashes 
of light that broke through the wooden slats as they went through sleeping towns he saw the man 
corpses, woman corpses, child corpses who would be thrown into the sea like rejected bananas. He 
recognized only a woman who sold drinks in the square and Colonel Gavilan, who still held 
wrapped in his hand the belt with a buckle of Morelia silver with which he had tried to open his way 
through the panic. When he got to the first car he jumped into the darkness and lay beside the tracks 
until the train had passed. It was the longest one he had ever seen, with almost two hundred freight 
cars and a locomotive at either end and a third one in the middle. It had no lights, not even the red 
and green running lights, and it slipped off with a nocturnal and stealthy velocity. On top of the cars 
there could be seen the dark shapes of the soldiers with their emplaced machine guns. 

After midnight a torrential cloudburst came up. Jose Arcadio Segundo did not know where it was 
that he had jumped off, but he knew that by going in the opposite direction to that of the train he 
would reach Macondo. After walking for more than three hours, soaked to the skin, with a terrible 
headache, he was able to make out the first houses in the light of dawn. Attracted by the smell of 
coffee, he went into a kitchen where a woman with a child in her arms was leaning over the stove. 

“Hello,” he said, exhausted. “I’m Jose Arcadio Segundo Buendia.” 

He pronounced his whole name, letter by letter, in order to convince her that he was alive. He 
was wise in doing so, because the woman had thought that he was an apparition as she saw the dirty, 
shadowy figure with his head and clothing dirty with blood and touched with the solemnity of death 
come through the door. She recognized him. She brought him a blanket so that he could wrap 
himself up while his clothes dried by the fire, she warmed some water to wash his wound, which was 
only a flesh wound, and she gave him a clean diaper to bandage his head. Then she gave him a mug 
of coffee without sugar as she had been told the Buendias drank it, and she spread his clothing out 
near the fire. 

Jose Arcadio Segundo did not speak until he had finished drinking his coffee. 


150 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


“There must have been three thousand of them” he murmured. 

“What?” 

“The dead,” he clarified. “It must have been an of the people who were at the station.” 

The woman measured him with a pitying look. “There haven’t been any dead here,” she said. 
“Since the time of your uncle, the colonel, nothing has happened in Macondo.” In the three kitchens 
where Jose Arcadio Segundo stopped before reaching home they told him the same thing. “There 
weren’t any dead. He went through the small square by the station and he saw the fritter stands piled 
one on top of the other and he could find no trace of the massacre. The streets were deserted under 
the persistent rain and the houses locked up with no trace of life inside. The only human note was 
the first tolling of the bells for mass. He knocked at the door at Colonel Gavilan’s house. A pregnant 
woman whom he had seen several times closed the door in his face. “He left,” she said, frightened. 
“He went back to his own country.” The main entrance to the wire chicken coop was guarded as 
always by two local policemen who looked as if they were made of stone under the rain, with 
raincoats and mbber boots. On their marginal street the West Indian Negroes were singing Saturday 
psalms. Jose Arcadio Segundo jumped over the courtyard wall and entered the house through the 
kitchen. Santa Sofia de la Piedad barely raised her voice. “Don’t let Fernanda see you,” she said. 
“She’s just getting up.” As if she were fulfilling an implicit pact, she took her son to the 
“chamberpot room.” arranged Melquiades’ broken-down cot for him and at two in the afternoon, 
while Fernanda was taking her siesta, she passed a plate of food in to him through the window. 

Aureliano Segundo had slept at home because the rain had caught him time and at three in the 
afternoon he was still waiting for it to clear. Informed in secret by Santa Sofia de la Piedad, he 
visited his brother in Melquiades’ room at that time. He did not believe the version of the massacre 
or the nightmare trip of the train loaded with corpses traveling toward the sea either. The night 
before he had read an extraordinary proclamation to the nation which said that the workers had left 
the station and had returned home in peaceful groups. The proclamation also stated that the union 
leaders, with great patriotic spirit, had reduced their demands to two points: a reform of medical 
services and the building of latrines in the living quarters. It was stated later that when the military 
authorities obtained the agreement with the workers, they hastened to tell Mr. Brown and he not 
only accepted the new conditions but offered to pay for three days of public festivities to celebrate 
the end of the conflict. Except that when the military asked him on what date they could announce 
the signing of the agreement, he looked out the window at the sky crossed with lightning flashes and 
made a profound gesture of doubt. 

“When the rain stops,” he said. “As long as the rain lasts we’re suspending all activities.” 

It had not rained for three months and there had been a drought. But when Mr. Brown 
announced his decision a torrential downpour spread over the whole banana region. It was the one 
that caught Jose Arcadio Segundo on his way to Macondo. A week later it was still raining. The 
official version, repeated a thousand times and mangled out all over the country by every means of 
communication the government found at hand, was finally accepted: there were no dead, the 
satisfied workers had gone back to their families, and the banana company was suspending all 
activity until the rains stopped. Martial law continued with an eye to the necessity of taking 
emergency measures for the public disaster of the endless downpour, but the troops were confined 
to quarters. During the day the soldiers walked through the torrents in the streets with their pant 
legs rolled up, playing with boats with the children. At night after taps, they knocked doors down 
with their rifle butts, hauled suspects out of their beds, and took them off on trips from which there 
was no return. The search for and extermination of the hoodlums, murderers, arsonists, and rebels 
of Decree No. 4 was still going on, but the military denied it even to the relatives of the victims who 
crowded the commandant’s offices in search of news. “You must have been dreaming,” the officers 


151 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


insisted. “Nothing has happened in Macondo, nothing has ever happened, and nothing ever will 
happen. “This is a happy town.” In that way they were finally able to wipe out the union leaders. 

The only survivor was Jose Arcadio Segundo. One February night the unmistakable blows of rifle 
butts were heard at the door. Aureliano Segundo, who was still waiting for it to clear, opened the 
door to six soldiers under the command of an officer. Soaking from the rain, without saying a word, 
they searched the house room by room, closet by closet, from parlor to pantry. Ursula woke up 
when they turned on the light in her room and she did not breathe while the march went on but 
held her fingers in the shape of a cross, pointing them to where the soldiers were moving about. 
Santa Sofia de la Piedad managed to warn Jose Arcadio Segundo, who was sleeping in Melquiades’ 
room, but he could see that it was too late to try to escape. So Santa Sofia de la Piedad locked the 
door again and he put on his shirt and his shoes and sat down on the cot to wait for them. At that 
moment they were searching the gold workshop. The officer made them open the padlock and with 
a quick sweep of his lantern he saw the workbench and the glass cupboard with bottles of acid and 
instruments that were still where their owner had left them and he seemed to understand that no 
one lived in that room. He wisely asked Aureliano Segundo if he was a silversmith, however, and the 
latter explained to him that it had been Colonel Aureliano Buendia’s workshop. “Oho,” the officer 
said, turned on the lights, and ordered such a minute search that they did not miss the eighteen little 
gold fishes that had not been melted down and that were hidden behind the bottles Is their tin can. 
The officer examined them one by one on the workbench and then he turned human. “I’d like to 
take one, if I may,” he said. “At one time they were a mark of subversion, but now they’re relics.” - 
He was young, almost an adolescent, with no sign of timidity and with a natural pleasant manner 
that had not shown itself until then. Aureliano Segundo gave him the little fish. The officer put it in 
his shirt pocket with a childlike glow in his eyes and he put the others back in the can and set it back 
where it had been. 

“It’s a wonderful memento,” he said. “Colonel Aureliano Buendfa was one of our greatest men.” 

Nevertheless, that surge of humanity did not alter his professional conduct. At Melquiades’ room, 
which was locked up again with the padlock, Santa Sofia de la Piedad tried one last hope. “No one 
has lived in that room for a century,” she said. The officer had it opened and flashed the beam of 
the lantern over it, and Aureliano Segundo and Santa Sofia de la Piedad saw the Arab eyes of Jose 
Arcadio Segundo at the moment when the ray of light passed over his face and they understood that 
it was the end of one anxiety and the beginning of another which would find relief only in 
resignation. But the officer continued examining the room with the lantern and showed no sign of 
interest until he discovered the seventy-two chamberpots piled up in the cupboards. Then he turned 
on the light. Jose Arcadio Segundo was sitting on the edge of the cot, ready to go, more solemn and 
pensive than ever. In the background were the shelves with the shredded books, the rolls of 
parchment, and the clean and orderly worktable with the ink still fresh in the inkwells. There was the 
same pureness in the air, the same clarity, the same respite from dust and destruction that Aureliano 
Segundo had known in childhood and that only Colonel Aureliano Buendia could not perceive. But 
the officer was only interested in the chamberpots. 

“How many people live in this house?’ he asked. 

“Five.” 

The officer obviously did not understand. He paused with his glance on the space where 
Aureliano Segundo and Santa Soft de la Piedad were still seeing Jose Arcadio Segundo and the latter 
also realized that the soldier was looking at him without seeing him. Then he turned out the light 
and closed the door. When he spoke to the soldiers, Aureliano, Segundo understood that the young 
officer had seen the room with the same eyes as Colonel Aureliano Buendia. 

“It’s obvious that no one has been in that room for at least a hundred years.” the officer said to 
the soldiers. “There must even be snakes in there.” 


152

When the door closed, Jose Arcadio Segundo was sure that the war was over. Years before 
Colonel Aureliano Buendla had spoken to him about the fascination of war and had tried to show it 
to him with countless examples drawn from his own experience. He had believed him. But the night 
when the soldiers looked at him without seeing him while he thought about the tension of the past 
few months, the misery of jail, the panic at the station, and the train loaded with dead people, Jose 
Arcadio Segundo reached the conclusion that Colonel Aureliano Buendia was nothing but a faker or 
an imbecile. He could not understand why he had needed so many words to explain what he felt in 
war because one was enough: fear. In Melquiades’ room, on the other hand, protected by the 
supernatural light, by the sound of the rain, by the feeling of being invisible, he found the repose 
that he had not had for one single instant during his previous life, and the only fear that remained 
was that they would bury him alive. He told Santa Sofia de la Piedad about it when she brought him 
his daily meals and she promised to struggle to stay alive even beyond her natural forces in order to 
make sure that they would bury him dead. Free from all fear, Jose Arcadio Segundo dedicated 
himself then to pemse the manuscripts of Melquiades many times, and with so much more pleasure 
when he could not understand them. He became accustomed to the sound of the rain, which after 
two months had become another form of silence, and the only thing that disturbed his solitude was 
the coming and going of Santa Sofia de la Piedad. He asked her, therefore, to leave the meals on the 
windowsill and padlock the door. The rest of the family forgot about him including Fernanda, who 
did not mind leaving him there when she found that the soldiers had seen him without recognizing 
him. After six months of enclosure, since the soldiers had left Macondo Aureliano Segundo 
removed the padlock, looking for someone he could talk to until the rain stopped. As soon as he 
opened the door he felt the pestilential attack of the chamberpots, which were placed on the floor 
and all of which had been used several times. Jose Arcadio Segundo, devoured by baldness, 
indifferent to the air that had been sharpened by the nauseating vapors, was still reading and 
rereading the unintelligible parchments. He was illuminated by a seraphic glow. He scarcely raised 
his eyes when he heard the door open, but that look was enough for his brother to see repeated in it 
the irreparable fate of his great-grandfather. 

“There were more than three thousand of them,” was all that Jose Arcadio Segundo said. “I’m 
sure now that they were everybody who had been at the station.”

Chapter 16 


IT RAINED FOR four years, eleven months, and two days. There were periods of drizzle during which 
everyone put on his full dress and a convalescent look to celebrate the clearing, but the people soon 
grew accustomed to interpret the pauses as a sign of redoubled rain. The sky cmmbled into a set of 
destructive storms and out of the north came hurricanes that scattered roofs about and knocked 
down walls and uprooted every last plant of the banana groves. Just as during the insomnia plague, 
as Ursula came to remember during those days, the calamity itself inspired defenses against 
boredom. Aureliano Segundo was one of those who worked hardest not to be conquered by 
idleness. He had gone home for some minor matter on the night that Mr. Brown unleashed the 
storm, and Fernanda tried to help him with a half-blown-out umbrella that she found in a closet. “I 
don’t need it,” he said. “I’ll stay until it clears.” That was not, of course, an ironclad promise, but he 
would accomplish it literally. Since his clothes were at Petra Cotes’s, every three days he would take 
off what he had on and wait in his shorts until they washed. In order not to become bored, he 
dedicated himself to the task of repairing the many things that needed fixing in the house. He 
adjusted hinges, oiled locks, screwed knockers tight, and planed doorjambs. For several months he 
was seen wandering about with a toolbox that the gypsies must have left behind in Jose Arcadio 
Buendia’s days, and no one knew whether because of the involuntary exercise, the winter tedium or 
the imposed abstinence, but his belly was deflating little by little like a wineskin and his face of a 
beatific tortoise was becoming less bloodshot and his double chin less prominent until he became 
less pachydermic all over and was able to tie Iris own shoes again. Watching him putting in latches 
and repairing clocks, Fernanda wondered whether or not he too might be falling into the vice of 
building so that he could take apart like Colonel Aureliano Buendia and his little gold fishes, 
Amaranta and her shroud and her buttons, Jose Arcadio and the parchments, and Ursula and her 
memories. But that was not the case. The worst part was that the rain was affecting everything and 
the driest of machines would have flowers popping out among their gears if they were not oiled 
every three days, and the threads in brocades msted, and wet clothing would break out in a rash of 
saffron-colored moss. The air was so damp that fish could have come in through the doors and 
swum out the windows, floating through the atmosphere in the rooms. One morning Ursula woke 
up feeling that she was reaching her end in a placid swoon and she had already asked them to take 
her to Father Antonio Isabel, even if it had to be on a stretcher, when Santa Sofia de la Piedad 
discovered that her back was paved with leeches. She took them off one by one, crushing them with 
a firebrand before they bled her to death. It was necessary to dig canals to get the water out of the 
house and rid it of the frogs and snails so that they could dry the floors and take the bricks from 
under the bedposts and walk in shoes once more. Occupied with the many small details that called 
for his attention, Aureliano Segundo did not realize that he was getting old until one afternoon when 
he found himself contemplating the premature dusk from a rocking chair and thinking about Petra 
Cotes without quivering. There would have been no problem in going back to Fernanda’s insipid 
love, because her beauty had become solemn with age, but the rain had spared him from all 
emergencies of passion and had filled him with the spongy serenity of a lack of appetite. He amused 
himself thinking about the things that he could have done in other times with that rain which had 
already lasted a year. He had been one of the first to bring zinc sheets to Macondo, much earlier 
than their popularization by the banana company, simply to roof Petra Cotes’s bedroom with them 
and to take pleasure in the feeling of deep intimacy that the sprinkling of the rain produced at that 
time. But even those wild memories of his mad youth left him unmoved, just as during his last 
debauch he had exhausted his quota of salaciousness and all he had left was the marvelous gift of 


154 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


being able to remember it without bitterness or repentance. It might have been thought that the 
deluge had given him the opportunity to sit and reflect and that the business of the pliers and the 
oilcan had awakened in him the tardy yearning of so many useful trades that he might have followed 
in his life and did not; but neither case was tme, because the temptation of a sedentary domesticity 
that was besieging him was not the result of any rediscovery or moral lesion, it came from much 
farther off, unearthed by the rain’s pitchfork from the days when in Melquiades’ room he would 
read the prodigious fables about flying carpets and whales that fed on entire ships and their crews. It 
was during those days that in a moment of carelessness little Aureliano appeared on the porch and 
Inis grandfather recognized the secret of his identity. He cut Inis hair, dressed him taught him not to 
be afraid of people, and very soon it was evident that he was a legitimate Aureliano Buendia, with his 
high cheekbones, his startled look, and his solitary air. It was a relief for Fernanda. For some time 
she had measured the extent of her pridefulness, but she could not find any way to remedy it 
because the more she thought of solutions the less rational they seemed to her. If she had known 
that Aureliano Segundo was going to take things the way he did, with the fine pleasure of a 
grandfather, she would not have taken so many turns or got so mixed up, but would have freed 
herself from mortification the year before Amaranta Ursula, who already had her second teeth, 
thought of her nephew as a scurrying toy who was a consolation for the tedium of the rain. 
Aureliano Segundo remembered then the English encyclopedia that no one had since touched in 
Meme’s old room. He began to show the children the pictures, especially those of animals, and later 
on the maps and photographs of remote countries and famous people. Since he did not know any 
English and could identify only the most famous cities and people, he would invent names and 
legends to satisfy the children’s insatiable curiosity. 

Fernanda really believed that her husband was waiting for it to clear to return to his concubine. 
During the first months of the rain she was afraid that he would try to slip into her bedroom and 
that she would have to undergo the shame of revealing to him that she was incapable of 
reconciliation since the birth of Amaranta Ursula. That was the reason for her anxious correspon¬ 
dence with the invisible doctors, intermpted by frequent disasters of the mail. During the first 
months when it was learned that the trains were jumping their tracks in the rain, a letter from the 
invisible doctors told her that hers were not arriving. Later on, when contact with the unknown 
correspondents was broken, she had seriously thought of putting on the tiger mask that her husband 
had worn in the bloody carnival and having herself examined under a fictitious name by the banana 
company doctors. But one of the many people who regularly brought unpleasant news of the deluge 
had told her that the company was dismantling its dispensaries to move them to where it was not 
raining. Then she gave up hope. She resigned herself to waiting until the rain stopped and the mail 
service was back to normal, and in the meantime she sought relief from her secret ailments with 
recourse to her imagination, because she would rather have died than put herself in the hands of the 
only doctor left in Macondo, the extravagant Frenchman who ate grass like a donkey. She drew close 
to Ursula, trusting that she would know of some palliative for her attacks. But her twisted habit of 
not calling things by their names made her put first things last and use “expelled” for “gave birth” 
and “burning” for “flow” so that it would all be less shameful, with the result that Ursula reached 
the reasonable conclusion that her trouble was intestinal rather than uterine, and she advised her to 
take a dose of calomel on an empty stomach. If it had not been for that suffering, which would have 
had nothing shameful about it for someone who did not suffer as well from shamefulness, and if it 
had not been for the loss of the letters, the rain would not have bothered Fernanda, because, after 
all, her whole life had been spent as if it had been raining. She did not change her schedule or 
modify her ritual. When the table was still raised up on bricks and the chairs put on planks so that 
those at the table would not get their feet wet, she still served with linen tablecloths and fine 
chinaware and with lighted candles, because she felt that the calamities should not be used as a 


155 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


pretext for any relaxation in customs. No one went out into the street any more. If it had depended 
on Fernanda, they would never have done so, not only since it started raining but since long before 
that, because she felt that doors had been invented to stay closed and that curiosity for what was 
going on in the street was a matter for harlots. Yet she was the first one to look out when they were 
told that the funeral procession for Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was passing by and even though she 
only watched it through the half-opened window it left her in such a state of affliction that for a long 
time she repented in her weakness. 

She could not have conceived of a more desolate cortege. They had put the coffin in an oxcart 
over which they built a canopy of banana leaves, but the pressure of the rain was so intense and the 
streets so muddy that with every step the wheels got stuck and the covering was on the verge of 
falling apart. The streams of sad water that fell on the coffin were soaking the flag that had been 
placed on top which was actually the flag stained with blood and gunpowder that had been rejected 
by more honorable veterans. On the coffin they had also placed the saber with tassels of silver and 
copper, the same one that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez used to hang on the coat rack in order to go 
into Amaranta’s sewing room unarmed. Behind the cart, some barefoot and all of them with their 
pants rolled up, splashing in the mud were the last survivors of the surrender at Neerlandia carrying 
a drover’s staff in one hand and in the other a wreath of paper flowers that had become discolored 
in the rain. They appeared like an unreal vision along the street which still bore the name of Colonel 
Aureliano Buendia and they all looked at the house as they passed and turned the corner at the 
square, where they had to ask for help to move the cart, which was stuck. Ursula had herself carried 
to the door by Santa Sofia de la Piedad. She followed the difficulties of the procession with such 
attention that no one doubted that she was seeing it, especially because her raised hand of an 
archangelic messenger was moving with the swaying of the cart. 

“Good-bye, Gerineldo, my son,” she shouted. “Say hello to my people and tell them I’ll see them 
when it stops raining.” 

Aureliano Segundo helped her back to bed and with the same informality with which he always 
treated her, he asked her the meaning of her farewell. 

“It’s true,” she said. “I’m only waiting for the rain to stop in order to die.” 

The condition of the streets alarmed Aureliano Segundo. He finally became worried about the 
state of his animals and he threw an oilcloth over his head and sent to Petra Cotes’s house. He 
found her in the courtyard, in the water up to her waist, trying to float the corpse of a horse. 
Aureliano Segundo helped her with a lever, and the enormous swollen body gave a turn like a bell 
and was dragged away by the torrent of liquid mud. Since the rain began, all that Petra Cotes had 
done was to clear her courtyard of dead animals. During the first weeks she sent messages to 
Aureliano Segundo for him to take urgent measures and he had answered that there was no msh, 
that the situation was not alarming, that there would be plenty of time to think about something 
when it cleared. She sent him word that the horse pastures were being flooded, that the cattle were 
fleeing to high ground, where there was nothing to eat and where they were at the mercy of jaguars 
and sickness. “There’s nothing to be done,” Aureliano Segundo answered her. “Others will be born 
when it clears.” Petra Cates had seen them die in dusters and the was able to butcher only those 
stuck in the mud. She saw with quiet impotence how the deluge was pitilessly exterminating a 
fortune that at one time was considered the largest and most solid in Macondo, and of which 
nothing remained but pestilence. When Aureliano Segundo decided to go see what was going on, he 
found only the corpse of the horse and a squalid mule in the ruins of the stable. Petra Cotes watched 
him arrive without surprise, joy, or resentment, and she only allowed herself an ironic smile. 

“It’s about time!” she said. 

She had aged, all skin and bones, and her tapered eyes of a carnivorous animal had become sad 
and tame from looking at the rain so much. Aureliano Segundo stayed at her house more than three 


156 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


months, not because he felt better there than in that of his family, but because he needed all that 
time to make the decision to throw the piece of oilcloth back over his head. “There’s no rush,” he 
said, as he had said in the other home. “Let’s hope that it clears in the next few hours.” During the 
course of the first week he became accustomed to the inroads that time and the rain had made in the 
health of his concubine, and little by little he was seeing her as she had been before, remembering 
her jubilant excesses and the delirious fertility that her love provoked in the animals, and partly 
through love, partly through interest, one night during the second week he awoke her with urgent 
caresses. Petra Cotes did not react. “Go back to sleep,” she murmured. “These aren’t times for 
things like that.” Aureliano Segundo saw himself in the mirrors on the ceiling, saw Petra Cotes’s 
spinal column like a row of spools strung together along a cluster of withered nerves, and he saw 
that she was right, not because of the times but because of themselves, who were no longer up to 
those things. 

Aureliano Segundo returned home with Inis tmnks, convinced that not only Ursula but all the 
inhabitants of Macondo were waiting for it to dear in order to die. He had seen them as he passed 
by, sitting in their parlors with an absorbed look and folded arms, feeling unbroken time pass, 
relentless times, because it was useless to divide it into months and years, and the days into hours, 
when one could do nothing but contemplate the rain. The children greeted Aureliano Segundo with 
excitement because he was playing the asthmatic accordion for them again. But the concerts did not 
attract their attention as much as the sessions with the encyclopedia, and once more they got 
together in Meme’s room, where Aureliano Segundo’s imagination changed a dirigible into a flying 
elephant who was looking for a place to sleep among the clouds. On one occasion he came across a 
man on horseback who in spite of his strange outfit had a familiar look, and after examining him 
closely he came to the conclusion that it was a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. He showed it 
to Fernanda and she also admitted the resemblance of the horseman not only to the colonel but to 
everybody in the family, although he was actually a Tartar warrior. Time passed in that way with the 
Colossus of Rhodes and snake charmers until his wife told him that there were only three pounds of 
dried meat and a sack of rice left in the pantry. 

And what do you want me to do about it?” he asked. 

“I don’t know,” Fernanda answered. “That’s men’s business.” 

“Well,” Aureliano Segundo said, “something will be done when it clears.” 

He was more interested in the encyclopedia than In the domestic problem, even when he had to 
content himself with a scrap of meat and a little rice for lunch. “It’s impossible to do anything now,” 
he would say. “It can’t rain for the rest of our lives.” And while the urgencies of the pantry grew 
greater, Fernanda’s indignation also grew, until her eventual protests, her infrequent outbursts came 
forth in an uncontained, unchained torrent that begin one morning like the monotonous drone of a 
guitar and as the day advanced rose in pitch, richer and more splendid. Aureliano Segundo was not 
aware of the singsong until the following day after breakfast when he felt himself being bothered by 
a buzzing that was by then more fluid and louder than the sound of the rain, and it was Fernanda, 
who was walking throughout the house complaining that they had raised her to be a queen only to 
have her end up as a servant in a madhouse, with a lazy, idolatrous, libertine husband who lay on his 
back waiting for bread to rain down from heaven while she was straining her kidneys trying to keep 
afloat a home held together with pins where there was so much to do, so much to bear up under 
and repair from the time God gave Inis morning sunlight until it was time to go to bed that when she 
got there her eyes were full of ground glass, and yet no one ever said to her, “Good morning, 
Fernanda, did you sleep well?” Nor had they asked her, even out of courtesy, why she was so pale or 
why she awoke with purple rings under her eyes in spite of the fact that she expected it, of course, 
from a family that had always considered her a nuisance, an old rag, a booby painted on the wall, and 
who were always going around saying things against her behind her back, calling her church mouse.

calling her Pharisee, calling her crafty, and even Amaranta, may she rest in peace, had said aloud that 
she was one of those people who could not tell their rectums from their ashes, God have mercy, 
such words, and she had tolerated everything with resignation because of the Holy Father, but she 
had not been able to tolerate it any more when that evil Jose Arcadio Segundo said that the 
damnation of the family had come when it opened its doors to a stuck-up highlander, just imagine, a 
bossy highlander, Lord save us, a highlander daughter of evil spit of the same stripe as the 
highlanders the government sent to kill workers, you tell me, and he was referring to no one but her, 
the godchild of the Duke of Alba, a lady of such lineage that she made the liver of presidents’ wives 
quiver, a noble dame of fine blood like her, who had the right to sign eleven peninsular names and 
who was the only mortal creature in that town full of bastards who did not feel all confused at the 
sight of sixteen pieces of silverware, so that her adulterous husband could die of laughter afterward 
and say that so many knives and forks and spoons were not meant for a human being but for a 
centipede, and the only one who could tell with her eyes closed when the white wine was served and 
on what side and in which glass and when the red wine and on what side and in which glass, and not 
like that peasant of an Amaranta, may she rest in peace, who thought that white wine was served in 
the daytime and red wine at night, and the only one on the whole coast who could take pride in the 
fact that she took care of her bodily needs only in golden chamberpots, so that Colonel Aureliano 
Buendia, may he rest in peace, could have the effrontery to ask her with his Masonic Ill humor 
where she had received that privilege and whether she did not shit shit but shat sweet basil, just 
imagine, with those very words, and so that Renata, her own daughter, who through an oversight 
had seen her stool in the bedroom, had answered that even if the pot was all gold and with a coat of 
arms, what was inside was pure shit, physical shit, and worse even than any other kind because it was 
stuck-up highland shit, just imagine, her own daughter, so that she never had any illusions about the 
rest of the family, but in any case she had the right to expect a little more consideration from her 
husband because, for better or for worse, he was her consecrated spouse her helpmate, her legal 
despoiler, who took upon himself of his own free and sovereign will the grave responsibility of 
taking her away from her paternal home, where she never wanted for or suffered from anything, 
where she wove funeral wreaths as a pastime, since her godfather had sent a letter with his signature 
and the stamp of his ring on the sealing wax simply to say that the hands of his goddaughter were 
not meant for tasks of this world except to play the clavichord, and, nevertheless, her insane 
husband had taken her from her home with all manner of admonitions and warnings and had 
brought her to that frying pan of hell where a person could not breathe because of the heat, and 
before she had completed her Pentecostal fast he had gone off with his wandering trunks and his 
wastrel’s accordion to loaf in adultery with a wretch of whom it was only enough to see her behind, 
well, that’s been said, to see her wiggle her mare’s behind in order to guess that she was a, that she 
was a, just the opposite of her, who was a lady in a palace or a pigsty, at the table or in bed, a lady of 
breeding, God-fearing, obeying His laws and submissive to His wishes, and with whom he could not 
perform, naturally, the acrobatics and trampish antics that he did with the other one, who, of course, 
was ready for anything like the French matrons, and even worse, if one considers well, because they 
at least had the honesty to put a red light at their door, swinishness like that, just imagine, and that 
was all that was needed by the only and beloved daughter of Dona Renata Argote and Don 
Fernando del Carpio, and especially the latter, an upright man, a fine Christian, a Knight of the 
Order of the Holy Sepulcher, those who receive direct from God the privilege of remaining intact in 
their graves with their skin smooth like the cheeks of a bride and their eyes alive and clear like 
emeralds. 

“That’s not true,” Aureliano Segundo interrupted her. “He was already beginning to smell when 
they brought him here.” 


158 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


He had the patience to listen to her for a whole day until he caught her in a slip. Fernanda did not 
pay him any mind, but she lowered her voice. That night at dinner the exasperating buzzing of the 
singsong had conquered the sound of the rain. Aureliano, Segundo ate very little, with his head 
down, and he went to his room early. At breakfast on the following day Fernanda was trembling, 
with a look of not having slept well, and she seemed completely exhausted by her rancor. Never¬ 
theless, when her husband asked if it was not possible to have a soft-boiled egg, she did not answer 
simply that they had run out of eggs the week before, but she worked up a violent diatribe against 
men who spent their time contemplating their navels and then had the gall to ask for larks’ livers at 
the table. Aureliano Segundo took the children to look at the encyclopedia, as always, and Fernanda 
pretended to straighten out Meme’s room just so that he could listen to her muttering, of course, 
that it certainly took cheek for him to tell the poor innocents that there was a picture of Colonel 
Aureliano Buendia in the encyclopedia. During the afternoon, while the children were having their 
nap, Aureliano Segundo sat on the porch and Fernanda pursued him even there, provoking him, 
tormenting him, hovering about him with her implacable horsefly buzzing, saying that, of course, 
while there was nothing to eat except stones, her husband was sitting there like a sultan of Persia, 
watching it rain, because that was all he was, a slob, a sponge, a good-for-nothing, softer than cotton 
batting, used to living off women and convinced that he had married Jonah’s wife, who was so 
content with the story of the whale. Aureliano Segundo listened to her for more than two hours, 
impassive, as if he were deaf. He did not interrupt her until late in the afternoon, when he could no 
longer bear the echo of the bass drum that was tormenting his head. 

“Please shut up,” he begged. 

Fernanda, quite the contrary, raised her pitch. “I don’t have any reason to shut up,” she said. 
“Anyone who doesn’t want to listen to me can go someplace else.” Then Aureliano Segundo lost 
control. He stood up unhurriedly, as if he only intended to stretch, and with a perfectly regulated 
and methodical fury he grabbed the pots with the begonias one after the other, those with the ferns, 
the oregano, and one after the other he smashed them onto the floor. Fernanda was frightened 
because until then she had really not had a clear indication of the tremendous inner force of her 
singsong, but it was too late for any attempt at rectification. Intoxicated by the uncontained torrent 
of relief, Aureliano Segundo broke the glass on the china closet and piece by piece, without hurrying, 
he took out the chinaware and shattered it on the floor. Systematically, serenely, in the same 
parsimonious way in which he had papered the house with banknotes, he then set about smashing 
the Bohemian crystal ware against the walls, the hand-painted vases, the pictures of maidens in flow¬ 
er-laden boats, the mirrors in their gilded frames, everything that was breakable, from parlor to 
pantry, and he finished with the large earthen jar in the kitchen, which exploded in the middle of the 
courtyard with a hollow boom. Then he washed his hands, threw the oilcloth over himself, and 
before midnight he returned with a few strings of dried meat, several bags of rice, corn with weevils, 
and some emaciated bunches of bananas. From then on there was no more lack of food. 

Amaranta Ursula and little Aureliano would remember the rains as a happy time. In spite of 
Fernanda’s strictness, they would splash in the puddles in the courtyard, catch lizards and dissect 
them, and pretend that they were poisoning the soup with dust from butterfly wings when Santa 
Sofia de la Piedad was not looking Ursula was their most amusing plaything. They looked upon her 
as a big,, broken-down doll that they carried back and forth from one corner to another wrapped in 
colored cloth and with her face painted with soot and annatto, and once they were on the point of 
plucking out her eyes with the pruning shears as they had done with the frogs. Nothing gave them as 
much excitement as the wanderings of her mind. Something, indeed, must have happened to her 
mind during the third year of the rain, for she was gradually losing her sense of reality and confusing 
present time with remote periods of her life to the point where, on one occasion, she spent three 
days weeping deeply over the death of Petronila Iguaran, her great-grandmother, buried for over a 


159 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


century. She sank into such an insane state of confusion that she thought little Aureliano was her 
son the colonel during the time he was taken to see ice, and that the Jose Arcadio who was at that 
time in the seminary was her firstborn who had gone off with the gypsies. She spoke so much about 
the family that the children learned to make up imaginary visits with beings who had not only been 
dead for a long time, but who had existed at different times. Sitting on the bed, her hair covered 
with ashes and her face wrapped in a red kerchief, Ursula was happy in the midst of the unreal 
relatives whom the children described in all detail, as if they had really known them. Ursula would 
converse with her forebears about events that took place before her own existence, enjoying the 
news they gave her, and she would weep with them over deaths that were much more recent than 
the guests themselves. The children did not take long to notice that in the course of those ghostly 
visits Ursula would always ask a question destined to establish the one who had brought a life-size 
plaster Saint Joseph to the house to be kept until the rains stopped. It was in that way that Aureliano 
Segundo remembered the fortune buried in some place that only Ursula knew, but the questions and 
astute maneuvering that occurred to him were of no use because in the labyrinth of her madness she 
seemed to preserve enough of a margin of lucidity to keep the secret which she would reveal only to 
the one who could prove that he was the real owner of the buried gold. She was so skillful and strict 
that when Aureliano Segundo instmcted one of his carousing companions to pass himself off as the 
owner of the fortune, she got him all caught up in a minute interrogation sown with subtle traps. 

Convinced that Ursula would carry the secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a crew of 
diggers under the pretext that they were making some drainage canals in the courtyard and the 
backyard, and he himself took soundings in the earth with iron bars and all manner of metal- 
detectors without finding anything that resembled gold in three months of exhaustive exploration. 
Later on he went to Pilar Ternera with the hope that the cards would we more than the diggers, but 
she began by explaining that any attempt would be useless unless Ursula cut the cards. On the other 
hand, she confirmed the existence of the treasure with the precision of its consisting of seven 
thousand two hundred fourteen coins buried in three canvas sacks reinforced with copper wire 
within a circle with a radius of three hundred eighty-eight feet with Ursula’s bed as the center, but 
she warned that it would not be found until it stopped raining and the suns of three consecutive 
Junes had changed the piles of mud into dust. The profusion and meticulous vagueness of the 
information seemed to Aureliano Segundo so similar to the tales of spiritualists that he kept on with 
his enterprise in spite of the fact that they were in August and they would have to wait at least three 
years in order to satisfy the conditions of the prediction. The first thing that startled him, even 
though it increased his confusion at the same time, was the fact that it was precisely three hundred 
eighty-eight feet from Ursula’s bed to the backyard wall. Fernanda feared that he was as crazy as his 
twin brother when she saw him taking the measurements, and even more when he told the digging 
crew to make the ditches three feet deeper. Overcome by an exploratory delirium comparable only 
to that of his great-grandfather when he was searching for the route of inventions, Aureliano Segun¬ 
do lost the last layers of fat that he had left and the old resemblance to his twin brother was 
becoming accentuated again, not only because of his slim figure, but also because of the distant air 
and the withdrawn attitude. He no longer bothered with the children. He ate at odd hours, muddled 
from head to toe, and he did so in a corner in the kitchen, barely answering the occasional questions 
asked by Santa Sofia de la Piedad. Seeing him work that way, as she had never dreamed him capable 
of doing, Fernanda thought that his stubbornness was diligence, his greed abnegation, and his thick¬ 
headedness perseverance, and her insides tightened with remorse over the vimlence with which she 
had attacked his idleness. But Aureliano Segundo was in no mood for merciful reconciliations at that 
time. Sunk up to his neck in a morass of dead brandies and rotting flowers, he flung the dirt of the 
garden all about after having finished with the courtyard and the backyard, and he excavated so 
deeply under the foundations of the east wing of the house that one night they woke up in terror at 


160 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


what seemed to be an earthquake, as much because of the trembling as the fearful underground 
creaking. Three of the rooms were collapsing and a frightening crack had opened up from the porch 
to Fernanda’s room. Aureliano Segundo did not give up the search because of that. Even when his 
last hopes had been extinguished and the only thing that seemed to make any sense was what the 
cards had predicted, he reinforced the jagged foundation, repaired the crack with mortar, and 
continued on the side to the west. He was still there on the second week of the following June when 
the rain began to abate and the clouds began to lift and it was obvious from one moment to the next 
that it was going to clear. That was what happened. On Friday at two in the afternoon the world 
lighted up with a crazy crimson sun as harsh as brick dust and almost as cool as water, and it did not 
rain again for ten years. 

Macondo was in mins. In the swampy streets there were the remains of furniture, animal 
skeletons covered with red lilies, the last memories of the hordes of newcomers who had fled 
Macondo as wildly as they had arrived. The houses that had been built with such haste during the 
banana fever had been abandoned. The banana company tore down its installations. All that 
remained of the former wired-in city were the ruins. The wooden houses, the cool terraces for 
breezy card-playing afternoons, seemed to have been blown away in an anticipation of the prophetic 
wind that years later would wipe Macondo off the face of the earth. The only human trace left by 
that voracious blast was a glove belonging to Patricia Brown in an automobile smothered in wild 
pansies. The enchanted region explored by Jose Arcadio Buendia in the days of the founding, where 
later on the banana plantations flourished, was a bog of rotting roots, on the horizon of which one 
could manage to see the silent foam of the sea. Aureliano Segundo went through a crisis of affliction 
on the first Sunday that he put on dry clothes and went out to renew his acquaintance with the 
town. The survivors of the catastrophe, the same ones who had been living in Macondo before it 
had been struck by the banana company hurricane, were sitting in the middle of the street enjoying 
their first sunshine. They still had the green of the algae on their skin and the musty smell of a 
corner that had been stamped on them by the rain, but in their hearts they seemed happy to have 
recovered the town in which they had been born. The Street of the Turks was again what it had 
been earlier, in the days when the Arabs with slippers and rings in their ears were going about the 
world swapping knickknacks for macaws and had found in Macondo a good bend in the road where 
they could find respite from their age-old lot as wanderers. Having crossed through to the other side 
of the rain, the merchandise in the booths was falling apart, the cloths spread over the doors were 
splotched with mold, the counters undermined by termites, the walls eaten away by dampness, but 
the Arabs of the third generation were sitting in the same place and in the same position as their 
fathers and grandfathers, taciturn, dauntless, invulnerable to time and disaster, as alive or as dead as 
they had been after the insomnia plague and Colonel Aureliano Buendia’s thirty-two wars. Their 
strength of spirit in the face of ruins of the gaming tables, the fritter stands, the shooting galleries, 
and the alley where they interpreted dreams and predicted the future made Aureliano Segundo ask 
them with his usual informality what mysterious resources they had relied upon so as not to have 
gone awash in the storm, what the devil they had done so as not to drown, and one after the other, 
from door to door, they returned a crafty smile and a dreamy look, and without any previous 
consultation they all gave the answer: 

“Swimming.” 

Petra Cotes was perhaps the only native who had an Arab heart. She had seen the final 
destruction of her stables, her barns dragged off by the storm, but she had managed to keep her 
house standing. During the second year she had sent pressing messages to Aureliano Segundo and 
he had answered that he did not know when he would go back to her house, but that in any case he 
would bring along a box of gold coins to pave the bedroom floor with. At that time she had dug 
deep into her heart, searching for the strength that would allow her to survive the misfortune, and 


161 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


she had discovered a reflective and just rage with which she had sworn to restore the fortune 
squandered by her lover and then wiped out by the deluge. It was such an unbreakable decision that 
Aureliano Segundo went back to her house eight months after the last message and found her green 
disheveled, with sunken eyelids and skin spangled with mange, but she was writing out numbers on 
small pieces of paper to make a raffle. Aureliano Segundo was astonished, and he was so dirty and 
so solemn that Petra Cotes almost believed that the one who had come to see her was not the lover 
of all her life but his twin brother. 

“You’re crazy,” he told her. “Unless you plan to raffle off bones.” 

Then she told him to look in the bedroom and Aureliano Segundo saw the mule. Its skin was 
clinging to its bones like that of its mistress, but it was just as alive and resolute as she. Petra Cotes 
had fed it with her wrath, and when there was no more hay or corn or roots, she had given it shelter 
in her own bedroom and fed it on the percale sheets, the Persian rugs, the plush bedspreads, the 
velvet drapes, and the canopy embroidered with gold thread and silk tassels on the episcopal bed.

Chapter 17 


URSULA HAD to make a great effort to fulfill her promise to die when it cleared. The waves of 
lucidity that were so scarce during the rains became more frequent after August, when an and wind 
began to blow and suffocated the rose bushes and petrified the piles of mud, and ended up 
scattering over Macondo the burning dust that covered the rusted zinc roofs and the age-old almond 
trees forever. Ursula cried in lamentation when she discovered that for more than three years she 
had been a plaything for the children. She washed her painted face, took off the strips of brightly 
colored cloth, the dried lizards and frogs, and the rosaries and old Arab necklaces that they had hung 
all over her body, and for the first time since the death of Amaranta she got up out of bed without 
anybody’s help to join in the family life once more. The spirit of her invincible heart guided her 
through the shadows. Those who noticed her stumbling and who bumped into the archangelic arm 
she kept raised at head level thought that she was having trouble with her body, but they still did not 
think she was blind. She did not need to see to realize that the flower beds, cultivated with such care 
since the first rebuilding, had been destroyed by the rain and mined by Aureliano Segundo’s 
excavations, and that the walls and the cement of the floors were cracked, the furniture mushy and 
discolored, the doors off their hinges, and the family menaced by a spirit of resignation and despair 
that was inconceivable in her time. Feeling her way along through the empty bedrooms she 
perceived the continuous rumble of the termites as they carved the wood, the snipping of the moths 
in the clothes closets, and the devastating noise of the enormous red ants that had prospered during 
the deluge and were undermining the foundations of the house. One day she opened the tmnk with 
the saints and had to ask Santa Sofia de la Piedad to get off her body the cockroaches that jumped 
out and that had already turned the clothing to dust. “A person can’t live in neglect like this,” she 
said. “If we go on like this we’ll be devoured by animals.” From then on she did not have a moment 
of repose. Up before dawn, she would use anybody available, even the children. She put the few 
articles of clothing that were still usable out into the sun, she drove the cockroaches off with 
powerful insecticide attacks, she scratched out the veins that the termites had made on doors and 
windows and asphyxiated the ants in their anthills with quicklime. The fever of restoration finally 
brought her to the forgotten rooms. She cleared out the rubble and cobwebs in the room where Jose 
Arcadio Buendfa had lost his wits looking for the Philosopher’s stone, she put the silver shop which 
had been upset by the soldiers in order, and lastly she asked for the keys to Melquiades’ room to see 
what state it was in. Faithful to the wishes of Jose Arcadio Segundo, who had forbidden anyone to 
come in unless there was a clear indication that he had died, Santa Sofia de la Piedad tried all kinds 
of subterfuges to throw Ursula off the track. But so inflexible was her determination not to 
surrender even the most remote corner of the house to the insects that she knocked down every 
obstacle in her path, and after three days of insistence she succeeded in getting them to open the 
door for her. She had to hold on to the doorjamb so that the stench would not knock her over, but 
she needed only two seconds to remember that the schoolgirls’ seventy-two chamberpots were in 
there and that on one of the rainy nights a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking for Jose 
Arcadio Segundo and had been unable to find him. 

“Lord save us!” she exclaimed, as if she could see everything. “So much trouble teaching you 
good manners and you end up living like a pig.” 

Jose Arcadio Segundo was still reading over the parchments. The only thing visible in the 
intricate tangle of hair was the teeth striped with green dime and his motionless eyes. When he 
recognized his great-grandmother’s voice he turned his head toward the door, tried to smile, and 
without knowing it repeated an old phrase of Ursula’s. 


163 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


“What did you expect?” he murmured. “Time passes.” 

“That’s how it goes,” Ursula said, “but not so much.” 

When she said it she realized that she was giving the same reply that Colonel Aureliano Buendia 
had given in his death cell, and once again she shuddered with the evidence that time was not 
passing, as she had just admitted, but that it was turning in a circle. But even then she did not give 
resignation a chance. She scolded Jose Arcadio Segundo as if he were a child and insisted that he 
take a bath and shave and lend a hand in fixing up the house. The simple idea of abandoning the 
room that had given him peace terrified Jose Arcadio Segundo. He shouted that there was no 
human power capable of making him go out because he did not want to see the train with two 
hundred cars loaded with dead people which left Macondo every day at dusk on its way to the sea. 
“They were all of those who were at the station,” he shouted. “Three thousand four hundred eight.” 
Only then did Ursula realize that he was in a world of shadows more impenetrable than hers, as un¬ 
reachable and solitary as that of his great-grandfather. She left him in the room, but she succeeded in 
getting them to leave the padlock off, clean it every day, throw the chamberpots away except for 
one, and to keep Jose Arcadio Segundo as clean and presentable as Iris great-grandfather had been 
during his long captivity under the chestnut tree. At first Fernanda interpreted that bustle as an 
attack of senile madness and it was difficult for her to suppress her exasperation. But about that time 
Jose Arcadio told her that he planned to come to Macondo from Rome before taking his final vows, 
and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that from morning to night she would be seen 
watering the flowers four times a day so that her son would not have a bad impression of the house. 
It was that same incentive which induced her to speed up her correspondence with the invisible 
doctors and to replace the pots of ferns and oregano and the begonias on the porch even before 
Ursula found out that they had been destroyed by Aureliano Segundo’s exterminating fury. Later on 
she sold the silver service and bought ceramic dishes, pewter bowls and soup spoons, and alpaca 
tablecloths, and with them brought poverty to the cupboards that had been accustomed to India 
Company chinaware and Bohemian crystal. Ursula always tried to go a step beyond. “Open the 
windows and the doors,” she shouted. “Cook some meat and fish, buy the largest turtles around, let 
strangers come and spread their mats in the corners and urinate in the rose bushes and sit down to 
eat as many times as they want and belch and rant and muddy everything with their boots, and let 
them do whatever they want to us, because that’s the only way to drive off rain.” But it was a vain 
illusion. She was too old then and living on borrowed time to repeat the miracle of the little candy 
animals, and none of her descendants had inherited her strength. The house stayed closed on 
Fernanda’s orders. 

Aureliano Segundo, who had taken his tmnks back to the house of Petra Cotes, barely had 
enough means to see that the family did not starve to death. With the raffling of the mule, Petra 
Cotes and he bought some more animals with which they managed to set up a primitive lottery 
business. Aureliano Segundo would go from house to house selling the tickets that he himself 
painted with colored ink to make them more attractive and convincing, and perhaps he did not 
realize that many people bought them out of gratitude and most of them out of pity. Nevertheless, 
even the most pitying purchaser was getting a chance to win a pig for twenty cents or a calf for 
thirty-two, and they became so hopeful that on Tuesday nights Petra Cotes’s courtyard overflowed 
with people waiting for the moment when a child picked at random drew the winning number from 
a bag. It did not take long to become a weekly fair, for at dusk food and drink stands would be set 
up in the courtyard and many of those who were favored would slaughter the animals they had won 
right there on the condition that someone else supply the liquor and music, so that without having 
wanted to, Aureliano Segundo suddenly found himself playing the accordion again and participating 
in modest tourneys of voracity. Those humble replicas of the revelry of former times served to show 
Aureliano Segundo himself how much his spirits had declined and to what a degree his skill as a 


164 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


masterful carouser had dried up. He was a changed man. The two hundred forty pounds that he had 
attained during the days when he had been challenged by The Elephant had been reduced to one 
hundred fifty-six; the glowing and bloated tortoise face had turned into that of an iguana, and he was 
always on the verge of boredom and fatigue. For Petra Cotes, however, he had never been a better 
man than at that time, perhaps because the pity that he inspired was mixed with love, and because of 
the feeling of solidarity that misery aroused in both of them. The broken-down bed ceased to be the 
scene of wild activities and was changed into an intimate refuge. Freed of the repetitious mirrors, 
which had been auctioned off to buy animals for the lottery, and from the lewd damasks and velvets, 
which the mule had eaten, they would stay up very late with the innocence of two sleepless 
grandparents, taking advantage of the time to draw up accounts and put away pennies which they 
formerly wasted just for the sake of it. Sometimes the cock’s crow would find them piling and 
unpiling coins, taking a bit away from here to put there, to that this bunch would be enough to keep 
Fernanda happy and that would be for Amaranta Ursula’s shoes, and that other one for Santa Sofia 
de la Piedad, who had not had a new dress since the time of all the noise, and this to order the coffin 
if Ursula died, and this for the coffee which was going up a cent a pound in price every three 
months, and this for the sugar which sweetened less every day, and this for the lumber which was 
still wet from the rains, and this other one for the paper and the colored ink to make tickets with, 
and what was left over to pay off the winner of the April calf whose hide they had miraculously 
saved when it came down with a symptomatic carbuncle just when all of the numbers in the raffle 
had already been sold. Those rites of poverty were so pure that they nearly always set aside the 
largest share for Fernanda, and they did not do so out of remorse or charity, but because her well¬ 
being was more important to them than their own. What was really happening to them, although 
neither of them realized it, was that they both thought of Fernanda as the daughter that they would 
have liked to have and never did, to the point where on a certain occasion they resigned themselves 
to eating crumbs for three days, so that she could buy a Dutch tablecloth. Nevertheless, no matter 
how much they killed themselves with work, no matter how much money they eked out, and no 
matter how many schemes they thought of, their guardian angels were asleep with fatigue while they 
put in coins and took them out trying to get just enough to live with. During the waking hours when 
the accounts were bad. they wondered what had happened in the world for the animals not to breed 
with the same drive as before, why money slipped through their fingers, and why people who a short 
time before had burned rolls of bills in the carousing considered it highway robbery to charge twelve 
cents for a raffle of six hens. Aureliano Segundo thought without saying so that the evil was not in 
the world but in some hidden place in the mysterious heart of Petra Cotes, where something had 
happened during the deluge that had turned the animals sterile and made money scarce. Intrigued by 
that enigma, he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because 
by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved 
him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she 
began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both 
looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an 
annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to fund the paradise of 
shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of 
loving each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they 
were two worn-out old people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like 
dogs. 

The raffles never got very far. At first Aureliano Segundo would spend three days of the week 
shut up in what had been Iris rancher’s office drawing ticket after ticket, Painting with a fair skill a 
red cow, a green pig, or a group of blue hens, according to the animal being raffled, and he would 
sketch out a good imitation of printed numbers and the name that Petra Cotes thought good to call 


165 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


the business: Divine Providence Raffles. But with time he felt so tired after drawing up to two thousand 
tickets a week that he had the animals, the name, and the numbers put on rubber stamps, and then 
the work was reduced to moistening them on pads of different colors. In his last years it occurred to 
him to substitute riddles for the numbers so that the prize could be shared by all of those who 
guessed it, but the system turned out to be so complicated and was open to so much suspicion that 
he gave it up after the second attempt. 

Aureliano Segundo was so busy trying to maintain the prestige of his raffles that he barely had 
time to see the children. Fernanda put Amaranta Ursula in a small private school where they 
admitted only six girls, but she refused to allow Aureliano to go to public school. She considered 
that she had already relented too much in letting him leave the room. Besides, the schools in those 
days accepted only the legitimate offspring of Catholic marriages and on the birth certificate that had 
been pinned to Aureliano’s clothing when they brought him to the house he was registered as a 
foundling. So he remained shut In at the mercy of Santa Sofia de la Piedad’s loving eyes and Ursula’s 
mental quirks, learning in the narrow world of the house whatever Iris grandmothers explained to 
him. He was delicate, thin, with a curiosity that unnerved the adults, but unlike the inquisitive and 
sometimes clairvoyant look that the colonel had at his age, his look was blinking and somewhat 
distracted. While Amaranta Ursula was in kindergarten, he would hunt earthworms and torture 
insects in the garden. But once when Fernanda caught him putting scorpions in a box to put in 
Ursula’s bed, she locked him up in Meme’s old room, where he spent his solitary hours looking 
through the pictures in the encyclopedia. Ursula found him there one afternoon when she was going 
about sprinkling the house with distilled water and a bunch of nettles, and in spite of the fact that 
she had been with him many times she asked him who he was. 

“I’m Aureliano Buendia,” he said. 

“That’s right” she replied. “And now it’s time for you to start learning how to be a silversmith.” 

She had confused him with her son again, because the hot wind that came after the deluge and 
had brought occasional waves of lucidity to Ursula’s brain had passed. She never got her reason 
back. When she went into the bedroom she found Petronila Iguaran there with the bothersome 
crinolines and the beaded jacket that she put on for formal visits, and she found Tranquilina Maria 
Miniata Alacoque Buendia, her grandmother, fanning herself with a peacock feather in her invalid’s 
rocking chair, and her great-grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendia, with his imitation dolman of 
the viceregal guard, and Aureliano Iguaran, her father, who had invented a prayer to make the 
worms shrivel up and drop off cows, and her timid mother, and her cousin with the pig’s tail, and 
Jose Arcadio Buendia, and her dead sons, all sitting in chairs lined up against the wall as if it were a 
wake and not a visit. She was tying a colorful string of chatter together, commenting on things from 
many separate places and many different times, so that when Amaranta Ursula returned from school 
and Aureliano grew tired of the encyclopedia, they would find her sitting on her bed, talking to 
herself and lost in a labyrinth of dead people. “Fire!” she shouted once in terror and for an instant 
panic spread through the house, but what she was telling about was the burning of a barn that she 
had witnessed when she was four years old. She finally mixed up the past with the present in such a 
way that in the two or three waves of lucidity that she had before she died, no one knew for certain 
whether she was speaking about what she felt or what she remembered. Little by little she was 
shrinking, turning into a fetus, becoming mummified in life to the point that in her last months she 
was a cherry raisin lost inside of her nightgown, and the arm that she always kept raised looked like 
the paw of a marimonda monkey. She was motionless for several days, and Santa Sofia de la Piedad 
had to shake her to convince herself that she was alive and sat her on her lap to feed her a few 
spoonfuls of sugar water. She looked like a newborn old woman. Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano 
would take her in and out of the bedroom, they would lay her on the altar to see if she was any 
larger than the Christ child, and one afternoon they hid her in a closet in the Pantry where the rats 


166 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


could have eaten her. One Palm Sunday they went into the bedroom while Fernanda was in church 
and carried Ursula out by the neck and ankles. 

“Poor great-great-grandmother,” Amaranta Ursula said. “She died of old age.” 

Ursula was startled. 

“Pm alive!” she said. 

“You can see.” Amaranta Ursula said, suppressing her laughter, “that she’s not even breathing.” 

“Pm talking!” Ursula shouted. 

“She can’t even talk,” Aureliano said. “She died like a little cricket.” 

Then Ursula gave in to the evidence. “My God,” she exclaimed in a low voice. “So this is what 
it’s like to be dead.” She started an endless, stumbling, deep prayer that lasted more than two days, 
and that by Tuesday had degenerated into a hodgepodge of requests to God and bits of practical 
advice to stop the red ants from bringing the house down, to keep the lamp burning by Remedios’ 
daguerreotype, and never to let any Buendia marry a person of the same blood because their 
children would be born with the tail of a pig. Aureliano Segundo tried to take advantage of her 
delirium to get her to ten him where the gold was buried, but his entreaties were useless once more 
“When the owner appears,” Ursula said, “God will illuminate him so that he will find it.” Santa Sofia 
de la Piedad had the certainty that they would find her dead from one moment to the next, because 
she noticed during those days a certain confusion in nature: the roses smelled like goosefoot, a pod 
of chick peas fell down and the beans lay on the ground in a perfect geometrical pattern in the shape 
of a starfish and one night she saw a row of luminous orange disks pass across the sky. 

They found her dead on the morning of Good Friday. The last time that they had helped her 
calculate her age, during the time of the banana company, she had estimated it as between one 
hundred fifteen and one hundred twenty-two. They buried her in a coffin that was not much larger 
than the basket in which Aureliano had arrived, and very few people were at the funeral, partly 
because there wet not many left who remembered her, and partly because it was so hot that noon 
that the birds in their confusion were running into walls like day pigeons and breaking through 
screens to die in the bedrooms. 

At first they thought it was a plague. Housewives were exhausted from sweeping away so many 
dead birds, especially at siesta time, and the men dumped them into the river by the cartload. On 
Easter Sunday the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isabel stated from the pulpit that the death of 
the birds was due to the evil influence of the Wandering Jew, whom he himself had seen the night 
before. He described him as a cross between a billy goat and a female heretic, an infernal beast 
whose breath scorched the air and whose look brought on the birth of monsters in newlywed 
women. There were not many who paid attention to his apocalyptic talk, for the town was 
convinced that the priest was rambling because of his age. But one woman woke everybody up at 
dawn on Wednesday because she found the tracks of a biped with a cloven hoof. They were so clear 
and unmistakable that those who went to look at them had no doubt about the existence of a 
fearsome creature similar to the one described by the parish priest and they got together to set traps 
in their courtyards. That was how they managed to capture it. Two weeks after Ursula’s death, Petra 
Cotes and Aureliano Segundo woke up frightened by the especially loud bellowing of a calf that was 
coming from nearby. When they got there a group of men were already pulling the monster off the 
sharpened stakes they had set in the bottom of a pit covered with dry leaves, and it stopped lowing. 
It was as heavy as an ox in spite of the fact that it was no taller than a young steer, and a green and 
greasy liquid flowed from its wounds. Its body was covered with rough hair, plagued with small 
ticks, and the skin was hardened with the scales of a remora fish, but unlike the priest’s description, 
its human parts were more like those of a sickly angel than of a man, for its hands were tense and 
agile, its eyes large and gloomy, and on its shoulder blades it had the scarred-over and calloused 
stumps of powerful wings which must have been chopped off by a woodsman’s ax. They hung it to 


167 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


an almond tree in the square by its ankles so that everyone could see it, and when it began to rot 
they burned it in a bonfire, for they could not determine whether its bastard nature was that of an 
animal to be thrown into the river or a human being to be buried. It was never established whether 
it had really caused the death of the birds, but the newly married women did not bear the predicted 
monsters, nor did the intensity of the heat decrease. 

Rebeca died at the end of that year. Argenida, her lifelong servant, asked the authorities for help 
to knock down the door to the bedroom where her mistress had been locked in for three days, and 
they found her, on her solitary bed, curled up like a shrimp, with her head bald from ringworm and 
her finger in her mouth. Aureliano Segundo took charge of the funeral and tried to restore the house 
in order to sell it, but the destruction was so far advanced in it that the walls became scaly as soon as 
they were painted and there was not enough mortar to stop the weeds from cracking the floors and 
the ivy from rotting the beams. 

That was how everything went after the deluge. The indolence of the people was in contrast to 
the voracity of oblivion, which little by little was undermining memories in a pitiless way, to such an 
extreme that at that time, on another anniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia, some emissaries from 
the president of the republic arrived in Macondo to award at last the decoration rejected several 
times by Colonel Aureliano Buendfa, and they spent a whole afternoon looking for someone who 
could tell them where they could find one of his descendants. Aureliano Segundo was tempted to 
accept it, thinking that it was a medal of solid gold, but Petra Cotes convinced him that it was not 
proper when the emissaries already had some proclamations and speeches ready for the ceremony. It 
was also around that time that the gypsies returned, the last heirs to Melqufades’ science, and they 
found the town so defeated and its inhabitants so removed from the rest of the world that once 
more they went through the houses dragging magnetized ingots as if that really were the Babylonian 
wise men’s latest discovery, and once again they concentrated the sun’s rays with the giant 
magnifying glass, and there was no lack of people standing open-mouthed watching kettles fall and 
pots roll and who paid fifty cents to be startled as a gypsy woman put in her false teeth and took 
them out again. A broken-down yellow train that neither brought anyone in nor took anyone out 
and that scarcely paused at the deserted station was the only thing that was left of the long train to 
which Mr. Brown would couple his glass-topped coach with the episcopal lounging chairs and of the 
fruit trains with one hundred twenty cars which took a whole afternoon to pass by. The ecclesiastical 
delegates who had come to investigate the report of the strange death of the birds and the sacrifice 
of the Wandering Jew found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man’s buff with the children, and 
thinking that Inis report was the product of a hallucination, they took him off to an asylum. A short 
time later they sent Father Augusto Angel, a crusader of the new breed, intransigent, audacious, 
daring, who personally rang the bells several times a day so that the peoples spirits would not get 
drowsy, and who went from house to house waking up the sleepers to go to mass but before a year 
was out he too was conquered by the negligence that one breathed in with the air, by the hot dust 
that made everything old and clogged up, and by the drowsiness caused by lunchtime meatballs in 
the unbearable heat of siesta time. 

With Ursula’s death the house again fell into a neglect from which it could not be rescued even 
by a will as resolute and vigorous as that of Amaranta Ursula, who many years later, being a happy, 
modern woman without prejudices, with her feet on the ground, opened doors and windows in 
order to drive away the rain, restored the garden, exterminated the red ants who were already 
walking across the porch in broad daylight, and tried in vain to reawaken the forgotten spirit of 
hospitality. Fernanda’s cloistered passion built in impenetrable dike against Ursula’s torrential 
hundred years. Not only did she refuse to open doors when the arid wind passed through, but she 
had the windows nailed shut with boards in the shape of a cross, obeying the paternal order of being 
buried alive. The expensive correspondence with the invisible doctors ended in failure. After 


168 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


numerous postponements, she shut herself up in her room on the date and hour agreed upon, 
covered only by a white sheet and with her head pointed north, and at one o’clock in the morning 
she felt that they were covering her head with a handkerchief soaked in a glacial liquid. When she 
woke up the sun was shining in the window and she had a barbarous stitch in the shape of an arc 
that began at her crotch and ended at her sternum. But before she could complete the prescribed 
rest she received a disturbed letter from the invisible doctors, who mid they had inspected her for 
six hours without finding anything that corresponded to the symptoms so many times and so 
scrupulously described by her. Actually, her pernicious habit of not calling things by their names had 
brought about a new confusion, for the only thing that the telepathic surgeons had found was a drop 
in the uterus which could be corrected by the use of a pessary. The disillusioned Fernanda tried to 
obtain more precise information, but the unknown correspondents did not answer her letters any 
more. She felt so defeated by the weight of an unknown word that she decided to put shame behind 
her and ask what a pessary was, and only then did she discover that the French doctor had hanged 
himself to a beam three months earlier and had been buried against the wishes of the townspeople 
by a former companion in arms of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. Then she confided in her son Jose 
Arcadio and the latter sent her the pessaries from Rome along with a pamphlet explaining their use, 
which she flushed down the toilet after committing it to memory so that no one would learn the 
nature of her troubles. It was a useless precaution because the only people who lived in the house 
scarcely paid any attention to her. Santa Sofia de la Piedad was wandering about in her solitary old 
age, cooking the little that they ate and almost completely dedicated to the care of Jose Arcadio 
Segundo. Amaranta Ursula, who had inherited certain attractions of Remedios the Beauty, spent the 
time that she had formerly wasted tormenting Ursula at her schoolwork, and she began to show 
good judgment and a dedication to study that brought back to Aureliano Segundo the high hopes 
that Meme had inspired in him. He had promised her to send her to finish her studies in Bmssels, in 
accord with a custom established during the time of the banana company, and that illusion had 
brought him to attempt to revive the lands devastated by the deluge. The few times that he appeared 
at the house were for Amaranta Ursula, because with time he had become a stranger to Fernanda 
and little Aureliano was becoming withdrawn as he approached puberty. Aureliano Segundo had 
faith that Fernanda’s heart would soften with old age so that the child could join in the life of the 
town where no one certainly would make any effort to speculate suspiciously about his origins. But 
Aureliano himself seemed to prefer the cloister of solitude and he did not show the least desire to 
know the world that began at the street door of the house. When Ursula had the door of 
Melquiades’ room opened he began to linger about it, peeping through the half-opened door, and no 
one knew at what moment he became close to Jose Arcadio Segundo in a link of mutual affection. 
Aureliano Segundo discovered that friendship a long time after it had begun, when he heard the 
child talking about the killing at the station. It happened once when someone at the table 
complained about the ruin into which the town had sunk when the banana company had abandoned 
it, and Aureliano contradicted him with maturity and with the vision of a grown person. His point of 
view, contrary to the general interpretation, was that Macondo had been a prosperous place and well 
on its way until it was disordered and cormpted and suppressed by the banana company, whose 
engineers brought on the deluge as a pretext to avoid promises made to the workers. Speaking with 
such good sense that to Fernanda he was like a sacrilegious parody of Jews among the wise men, the 
child described with precise and convincing details how the army had macliine-gunned more than 
three thousand workers penned up by the station and how they loaded the bodies onto a two- 
hundred-car train and threw them into the sea. Convinced as most people were by the official 
version that nothing had happened, Fernanda was scandalized with the idea that the child had 
inherited the anarchist ideas of Colonel Aureliano Buendia and told him to be quiet. Aureliano 
Segundo, on the other hand, recognized his twin brother’s version. Actually, in spite of the fact that 


169 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


everyone considered him mad, Jose Arcadio Segundo was at that time the most lucid inhabitant of 
the house. He taught little Aureliano how to read and write, initiated him in the study of the 
parchments, and he inculcated him with such a personal interpretation of what the banana company 
had meant to Macondo that many years later, when Aureliano became part of the world, one would 
have thought that he was telling a hallucinated version, because it was radically opposed to the false 
one that historians had created and consecrated in the schoolbooks. In the small isolated room 
where the arid air never penetrated, nor the dust, nor the heat, both had the atavistic vision of an old 
man, his back to the window, wearing a hat with a brim like the wings of a crow who spoke about 
the world many years before they had been born. Both described at the same time how it was always 
March there and always Monday, and then they understood that Jose Arcadio Buendia was not as 
crazy as the family said, but that he was the only one who had enough lucidity to sense the tmth of 
the fact that time also stumbled and had accidents and could therefore splinter and leave an 
eternalized fragment in a room. Jose Arcadio Segundo had managed, furthermore, to classify the 
cryptic letters of the parchments. He was certain that they corresponded to an alphabet of forty- 
seven to fifty-three characters, which when separated looked like scratching and scribbling, and 
which in the fine hand of Melquiades looked like pieces of clothing put out to dry on a line. 
Aureliano remembered having seen a similar table in the English encyclopedia, so he brought it to 
the room to compare it with that of Jose Arcadio Segundo. They were indeed the same. 

Around the time of the riddle lottery, Aureliano Segundo began waking up with a knot in his 
throat, as if he were repressing a desire to weep. Petra Cotes interpreted it as one more of so many 
upsets brought on by the bad situation, and every morning for over a year she would touch his 
palate with a dash of honey and give him some radish syrup. When the knot in his throat became so 
oppressive that it was difficult for him to breathe, Aureliano Segundo visited Pilar Ternera to see if 
she knew of some herb that would give him relief. The dauntless grandmother, who had reached a 
hundred years of age managing a small, clandestine brothel, did not tmst therapeutic superstitions, 
so she turned the matter over to her cards. She saw the queen of diamonds with her throat wounded 
by the steel of the jack of spades, and she deduced that Fernanda was trying to get her husband back 
home by means of the discredited method of sticking pins into his picture but that she had brought 
on an internal tumor because of her clumsy knowledge of the black arts. Since Aureliano Segundo 
had no other pictures except those of his wedding and the copies were all in the family album, he 
kept searching all through the house when his wife was not looking, and finally, in the bottom of the 
dresser, he came across a half-dozen pessaries in their original boxes. Thinking that the small red 
rubber rings were objects of witchcraft he put them in his pocket so that Pilar Ternera could have a 
look at them. She could not determine their nature, but they looked so suspicious to her that in any 
case she burned them in a bonfire she built in the courtyard. In order to conjure away Fernanda’s 
alleged curse, she told Aureliano Segundo that he should soak a broody hen and bury her alive under 
the chestnut tree, and he did it with such good faith that when he finished hiding the turned-up 
earth with dried leaves he already felt that he was breathing better. For her part, Fernanda 
interpreted the disappearance as a reprisal by the invisible doctors and she sewed a pocket of casing 
to the inside of her camisole where she kept the new pessaries that her son sent her. 

Six months after he had buried the hen, Aureliano Segundo woke up at midnight with an attack 
of coughing and the feeling that he was being strangled within by the claws of a crab. It was then 
that he understood that for all of the magical pessaries that he destroyed and all the conjuring hens 
that he soaked, the single and sad piece of truth was that he was dying. He did not tell anyone. 
Tormented by the fear of dying without having sent Amaranta Ursula to Bmssels, he worked as he 
had never done, and instead of one he made three weekly raffles. From very early in the morning he 
could be seen going through the town, even in the most outlying and miserable sections, trying to 
sell tickets with an anxiety that could only be conceivable in a dying man. “Here’s Divine 


170 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


Providence,” he hawked. “Don’t let it get away, because it only comes every hundred years.” He 
made pitiful efforts to appear gay, pleasant, talkative, but it was enough to see his sweat and paleness 
to know that his heart was not in it. Sometimes he would go to vacant lots, where no one could see 
him, and sit down to rest from the claws that were tearing him apart inside. Even at midnight he 
would be in the red-light district trying to console with predictions of good luck the lonely women 
who were weeping beside their phonographs. “This number hasn’t come up in four months,” he 
told them, showing them the tickets. “Don’t let it get away, life is shorter than you think.” They 
finally lost respect for him, made fun of him, and in his last months they no longer called him Don 
Aureliano, as they had always done, but they called him Mr. Divine Providence right to his face. His 
voice was becoming filled with wrong notes. It was getting out of tune, and it finally diminished into 
the growl of a dog, but he still had the drive to see that there should be no diminishing of the hope 
people brought to Petra Cates’s courtyard. As he lost his voice, however, and realized that in a short 
time he would be unable to bear the pain, he began to understand that it was not through raffled 
pigs and goats that his daughter would get to Brussels, so he conceived the idea of organizing the 
fabulous raffle of the lands destroyed by the deluge, which could easily be restored by a person with 
the money to do so. It was such a spectacular undertaking that the mayor himself lent his aid by 
announcing it in a proclamation, and associations were formed to buy tickets at one hundred pesos 
apiece and they were sold out in less than a week. The night of the raffle the winners held a huge 
celebration, comparable only to those of the good days of the banana company, and Aureliano 
Segundo, for the last time, played the forgotten songs of Francisco the Man on the accordion, but 
he could no longer sing them. 

Two months later Amaranta Ursula went to Bmssels. Aureliano Segundo gave her not only the 
money from the special raffle, but also what he had managed to put aside over the previous months 
and what little he had received from the sale of the pianola, the clavichord, and other junk that had 
fallen into disrepair. According to his calculations, that sum would be enough for her studies, so 
that all that was la clang was the price of her fare back home. Fernanda was against the trip until the 
last moment, scandalized by the idea that Brussels was so close to Paris and its perdition, but she 
calmed down with the letter that Father Angel gave her addressed to a boardinghouse run by nuns 
for Catholic young ladies where Amaranta Ursula promised to stay until her studies were completed. 
Furthermore, the parish priest arranged for her to travel under the care of a group of Franciscan 
nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to find dependable people to accompany her to 
Belgium. While the urgent correspondence that made the coordination possible went forward, 
Aureliano Segundo, aided by Petra Cates, prepared Amaranta Ursula’s baggage. The night on which 
they were packing one of Fernanda’s bridal trunks, the things were so well organized that the 
schoolgirl knew by heart which were the suits and cloth slippers she could wear crossing the Atlantic 
and the blue cloth coat with copper buttons and the cordovan shoes she would wear when she 
landed. She also knew how to walk so as not to fall into the water as she went up the gangplank, that 
at no time was she to leave the company of the nuns or leave her cabin except to eat, and that for no 
reason was she to answer the questions asked by people of any sex while they were at sea. She 
carried a small bottle with drops for seasickness and a notebook written by Father Angel in his own 
hand containing six prayers to be used against storms. Fernanda made her a canvas belt to keep her 
money in, and she would not have to take it off even to sleep. She tried to give her the chamberpot, 
washed out with lye and disinfected with alcohol, but Amaranta Ursula refused it for fear that her 
schoolmates would make fun of her. A few months later, at the hour of his death, Aureliano 
Segundo would remember her as he had seen her for the last time as she tried unsuccessfully to 
lower the window of the second-class coach to hear Fernanda’s last piece of advice. She was wearing 
a pink silk dress with a corsage of artificial pansies pinned to her left shoulder, her cordovan shoes 
with buckles and low heels, and sateen stockings held up at the thighs with elastic garters. Her body 


171 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


was slim, her hair loose and long, and she had the lively eyes that Ursula had had at her age and the 
way in which she said good-bye, without crying but without smiling either, revealed the same 
strength of character. Walking beside the coach as it picked up speed and holding Fernanda by the 
arm so that she would not stumble, Aureliano scarcely had time to wave at his daughter as she threw 
him a kiss with the tips of her fingers. The couple stood motionless under the scorching sun, 
looking at the train as it merged with the black strip of the horizon, linking arms for the first time 
since the day of their wedding. 

On the ninth of August, before they received the first letter from Brussels, Jose Arcadio Segundo 
was speaking to Aureliano in Melquiades’ room and, without realizing it, he said: 

“Always remember that they were more than three thousand and that they were thrown into the 
sea.” 

Then he fell back on the parchments and died with his eyes open. At that same instant, in 
Fernanda’s bed, his twin brother came to the end of the prolonged and terrible martyrdom of the 
steel crabs that were eating his throat away. One week previously he had returned home, without any 
voice, unable to breathe, and almost skin and bones, with his wandering trunks and his wastrel’s 
accordion, to fulfill the promise of dying beside his wife. Petra Cotes helped him pack his clothes 
and bade him farewell without shedding a tear, but she forgot to give him the patent leather shoes 
that he wanted to wear in his coffin. So when she heard that he had died, she dressed in black, 
wrapped the shoes up in a newspaper, and asked Fernanda for permission to see the body. Fernanda 
would not let her through the door. 

“Put yourself in my place,” Petra Cotes begged. “Imagine how much I must have loved him to 
put up with this humiliation.” 

“There is no humiliation that a concubine does not deserve,” Fernanda replied. “So wait until 
another one of your men dies and put the shoes on him.” 

In fulfillment of her promise, Santa Sofia de la Piedad cut the throat of Jose Arcadio Segundo’s 
corpse with a kitchen knife to be sure that they would not bury him alive. The bodies were placed in 
identical coffins, and then it could be seen that once more in death they had become as Identical as 
they had been until adolescence. Aureliano Segundo’s old carousing comrades laid on his casket a 
wreath that had a purple ribbon with the words: Cease, coivs, life is short. Fernanda was so indignant 
with such irreverence that she had the wreath thrown onto the trash heap. In the tumult of the last 
moment, the sad drunkards who carried them out of the house got the coffins mixed up and buried 
them in the wrong graves.

Chapter 18 


AURELIANO DID NOT leave Melquiades’ room for a long time. He learned by heart the fantastic 
legends of the crumbling books, the synthesis of the studies of Hermann the Cripple, the notes on 
the science of demonology, the keys to the philosopher’s stone, the Centuries of Nostradamus and his 
research concerning the plague, so that he reached adolescence without knowing a tiling about his 
own time but with the basic knowledge of a medieval man. Any time that Santa Sofia de la Piedad 
would go into his room she would find him absorbed in his reading. At dawn she would bring him a 
mug of coffee without sugar and at noon a plate of rice and slices of fried plantain, which were the 
only things eaten in the house since the death of Aureliano Segundo. She saw that his hair was cut, 
picked off the nits, took in to his size the old clothing that she found in forgotten tmnks, and when 
his mustache began to appear the brought him Colonel Aureliano Buendia’s razor and the small 
gourd he had used as a shaving mug. None of the latter’s children had looked so much like him, not 
even Aureliano Jose, particularly in respect to the prominent cheekbones and the firm and rather 
pitiless line of the lips. As had happened to Ursula with Aureliano Segundo when the latter was 
studying in the room, Santa Sofia de la Piedad thought that Aureliano was talking to himself. 
Actually, he was talking to Melquiades. One burning noon, a short time after the death of the twins, 
against the light of the window he saw the gloomy old man with his crow’s-wing hat like the 
materialization of a memory that had been in his head since long before he was born. Aureliano had 
finished classifying the alphabet of the parchments, so that when Melquiades asked him if he had 
discovered the language in which they had been written he did not hesitate to answer. 

“Sanskrit,” he said. 

Melquiades revealed to him that his opportunities to return to the room were limited. But he 
would go in peace to the meadows of the ultimate death because Aureliano would have time to learn 
Sanskrit during the years remaining until the parchments became one hundred years old, when they 
could be deciphered. It was he who indicated to Aureliano that on the narrow street going down to 
the river, where dreams had been interpreted during the time of the banana company, a wise 
Catalonian had a bookstore where there was a Sanskrit primer, which would be eaten by the moths 
within six years if he did not hurry to buy it. For the first time in her long life Santa Sofia de la 
Piedad let a feeling show through, and it was a feeling of wonderment when Aureliano asked her to 
bring him the book that could be found between Jerusalem Delivered and Milton’s poems on the 
extreme right-hand side of the second shelf of the bookcases. Since she could not read, she memo¬ 
rized what he had said and got some money by selling one of the seventeen little gold fishes left in 
the workshop, the whereabouts of which, after being hidden the night the soldiers searched the 
house, was known only by her and Aureliano. 

Aureliano made progress in his studies of Sanskrit as Melquiades’ visits became less and less 
frequent and he was more distant, fading away in the radiant light of noon. The last time that 
Aureliano sensed him he was only an invisible presence who murmured: “I died of fever on the 
sands of Singapore.” The room then became vulnerable to dust, heat, termites, red ants, and moths, 
who would turn the wisdom of the parchments into sawdust. 

There was no shortage of food in the house. The day after the death of Aureliano Segundo, one 
of the friends who had brought the wreath with the irreverent inscription offered to pay Fernanda 
some money that he had owed her husband. After that every Wednesday a delivery boy brought a 
basket of food that was quite sufficient for a week. No one ever knew that those provisions were 
being sent by Petra Cotes with the idea that the continuing charity was a way of humiliating the 
person who had humiliated her. Nevertheless, the rancor disappeared much sooner than she herself 


173 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


had expected, and then she continued sending the food out of pride and finally out of compassion. 
Several times, when she had no animals to raffle off and people lost interest in the lottery, she went 
without food so that Fernanda could have something to eat, and she continued fulfilling the pledge 
to herself until she saw Fernanda’s funeral procession pass by. 

For Santa Sofia de la Piedad the reduction in the number of inhabitants of the house should have 
meant the rest she deserved after more than half a century of work. Never a lament had been heard 
from that stealthy, impenetrable woman who had sown in the family the angelic seed of Remedios 
the Beauty and the mysterious solemnity of Jose Arcadio Segundo; who dedicated a whole life of 
solitude and diligence to the rearing of children although she could barely remember whether they 
were her children or grandchildren, and who took care of Aureliano as if he had come out of her 
womb, not knowing herself that she was his great-grandmother. Only in a house like that was it 
conceivable for her always to sleep on a mat she laid out on the pantry floor in the midst of the 
nocturnal noise of the rats, and without telling anyone that one night she had awakened with the 
frightened feeling that someone was looking at her in the darkness and that it was a poisonous snake 
crawling over her stomach. She knew that if she had told Ursula, the latter would have made her 
sleep in her own bed, but those were times when no one was aware of anything unless it was 
shouted on the porch, because with the bustle of the bakery, the surprises of the war, the care of the 
children, there was not much room for thinking about other peoples happiness. Petra Cotes whom 
she had never seen, was the only one who remembered her. She saw to it that she had a good pair of 
shoes for street wear, that she always had clothing, even during the times when the raffles were 
working only through some miracle. When Fernanda arrived at the house she had good reason to 
think that she was an ageless servant, and even though she heard it said several times that she was 
her husband’s mother it was so incredible that it took her longer to discover it than to forget it. 
Santa Sofia de la Piedad never seemed bothered by that lowly position. On the contrary, one had the 
impression that she liked to stay in the corners, without a pause, without a complaint, keeping clean 
and in order the immense house that she had lived in ever since adolescence and that, especially 
during the time of the banana company, was more like a barracks than a home. But when Ursula 
died the superhuman diligence of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, her tremendous capacity for work, began 
to fall apart. It was not only that she was old and exhausted, but overnight the house had plunged 
into a crisis of senility. A soft moss grew up the walls. When there was no longer a bare spot in the 
courtyard, the weeds broke through the cement of the porch, breaking it like glass, and out of the 
cracks grew the same yellow flowers that Ursula had found in the glass with Melquiades’ false teeth a 
century before. With neither the time nor the resources to halt the challenge of nature, Santa Sofia 
de la Piedad spent the day in the bedrooms driving out the lizards who would return at night. One 
morning she saw that the red ants had left the undermined foundations, crossed the garden, climbed 
up the railing, where the begonias had taken on an earthen color, and had penetrated into the heart 
of the house. She first tried to kill them with a broom, then with insecticides, and finally with lye, but 
the next day they were back in the same place, still passing by, tenacious and invincible. Fernanda, 
writing letters to her children, was not aware of the unchecked destructive attack. Santa Sofia de la 
Piedad continued struggling alone, fighting the weeds to stop them from getting into the kitchen, 
pulling from the walls the tassels of spider webs which were rebuilt in a few hours, scraping off the 
termites. But when she saw that Melquiades’ room was also dusty and filled with cobwebs even 
though she swept and dusted three times a day, and that in spite of her furious cleaning it was 
threatened by the debris and the air of misery that had been foreseen only by Colonel Aureliano 
Buendia and the young officer, she realized that she was defeated. Then she put on her worn Sunday 
dress, some old shoes of Ursula’s, and a pair of cotton stockings that Amaranta Ursula had given 
her, and she made a bundle out of the two or three changes of clothing that she had left. 

“I give up,” she said to Aureliano. “This is too much house for my poor bones.” 


174 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


Aureliano asked her where she was going and she made a vague sign, as if she did not have the 
slightest idea of her destination. She tried to be more precise, however, saying that she was going to 
spend her last years with a first cousin who lived in Riohacha. It was not a likely explanation. Since 
the death of her parents she had not had contact with anyone in town or received letters or 
messages, nor had she been heard to speak of any relatives. Aureliano gave her fourteen little gold 
fishes because she was determined to leave with only what she had: one peso and twenty-five cents. 
From the window of the room he saw her cross the courtyard with her bundle of clothing, dragging 
her feet and bent over by her years, and he saw her reach her hand through an opening in the main 
door and replace the bar after she had gone out. Nothing was ever heard of her again. 

When she heard about the flight, Fernanda ranted for a whole day as she checked trunks, 
dressers, and closets, item by item, to make sure that Santa Sofia de la Piedad had not made off with 
anything. She burned her fingers trying to light a fire for the first time in her life and she had to ask 
Aureliano to do her the favor of showing her how to make coffee. Fernanda would find her 
breakfast ready when she arose and she would leave her room again only to get the meal that 
Aureliano had left covered on the embers for her, which she would carry to the table to eat on linen 
tablecloths and between candelabra, sitting at the solitary head of the table facing fifteen empty 
chairs. Even under those circumstances Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their solitude, but 
both continued living on their own, cleaning their respective rooms while the cobwebs fell like snow 
on the rose bushes, carpeted the beams, cushioned the walls. It was around that time that Fernanda 
got the impression that the house was filling up with elves. It was as if things, especially those for 
everyday use, had developed a faculty for changing location on their own. Fernanda would waste 
time looking for the shears that she was sure she had put on the bed and after turning everything 
upside down she would find them on a shelf in the kitchen, where she thought she had not been for 
four days. Suddenly there was no fork in the silver chest and she would find six on the altar and 
three in the washroom. That wandering about of things was even more exasperating when she sat 
down to write. The inkwell that she had placed at her right would be on the left, the blotter would 
be lost and she would find it two days later under her pillow, and the pages written to Jose Arcadio 
would get mixed up with those written to Amaranta Ursula, and she always had the feeling of 
mortification that she had put the letters in opposite envelopes, as in fact happened several times. 
On one occasion she lost her fountain pen. Two weeks later the mailman, who had found it in his 
bag, returned it. He had been going from house to house looking for its owner. At first she thought 
it was some business of the invisible doctors, like the disappearance of the pessaries, and she even 
started a letter to them begging them to leave her alone, but she had to interrupt it to do something 
and when she went back to her room she not only did not find the letter she had started but she had 
forgotten the reason for writing it. For a time she thought it was Aureliano. She began to spy on 
him, to put things in his path trying to catch him when he changed their location, but she was soon 
convinced that Aureliano never left Melquiades’ room except to go to the kitchen or the toilet, and 
that he was not a man to play tricks. So in the end she believed that it was the mischief of elves and 
she decided to secure everything in the place where she would use it. She tied the shears to the head 
of her bed with a long string. She tied the pen and the blotter to the leg of the table, and the glued 
the inkwell to the top of it to the right of the place where she normally wrote. The problems were 
not solved overnight, because a few hours after she had tied the string to the shears it was not long 
enough for her to cut with, as if the elves had shortened it. The same tiling happened to her with the 
string to the pen and even with her own arm which after a short time of writing could not reach the 
inkwell. Neither Amaranta Ursula in Brussels nor Jose Arcadio in Rome ever heard about those 
insignificant misfortunes. Fernanda told them that she was happy and in reality she was, precisely 
because she felt free from any compromise, as if life were pulling her once more toward the world 
of her parents, where one did not suffer with day-to-day problems because they were solved 


175 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


beforehand in one’s imagination. That endless correspondence made her lose her sense of time, 
especially after Santa Sofia de la Piedad had left. She had been accustomed to keep track of the days, 
months, and years, using as points of reference the dates set for the return of her children. But when 
they changed their plans time and time again, the dates became confused, the periods were mislaid, 
and one day seemed so much like another that one could not feel them pass. Instead of becoming 
impatient, she felt a deep pleasure in the delay. It did not worry her that many years after 
announcing the eve of his final vows, Jose Arcadio was still saying that he was waiting to finish his 
studies in advanced theology in order to undertake those in diplomacy, because she understood how 
steep and paved with obstacles was the spiral stairway that led to the throne of Saint Peter. On the 
other hand, her spirits rose with news that would have been insignificant for other people, such as 
the fact that her son had seen the Pope. She felt a similar pleasure when Amaranta Ursula wrote to 
tell her that her studies would last longer than the time foreseen because her excellent grades had 
earned her privileges that her father had not taken into account in his calculations. 

More than three years had passed since Santa Sofia de la Piedad had brought him the grammar 
when Aureliano succeeded in translating the first sheet. It was not a useless chore, but it was only a 
first step along a road whose length it was impossible to predict, because the text in Spanish did not 
mean anything: the lines were in code. Aureliano lacked the means to establish the keys that would 
permit him to dig them out, but since Melquiades had told him that the books he needed to get to 
the bottom of the parchments were in the wise Catalonian’s store, he decided to speak to Fernanda 
so that she would let him get them. In the room devoured by rubble, whose unchecked proliferation 
had finally defeated it, he thought about the best way to frame the request, but when he found 
Fernanda taking her meal from the embers, which was his only chance to speak to her, the 
laboriously formulated request stuck in his throat and he lost his voice. That was the only time that 
he watched her. He listened to her steps in the bedroom. He heard her on her way to the door to 
await the letters from her children and to give hers to the mailman, and he listened until late at night 
to the harsh, impassioned scratching of her pen on the paper before hearing the sound of the light 
switch and the murmur of her prayers in the darkness. Only then did he go to sleep, trusting that on 
the following day the awaited opportunity would come. He became so inspired with the idea that 
permission would be granted that one morning he cut his hair, which at that time reached down to 
his shoulders, shaved off his tangled beard, put on some tight-fitting pants and a shirt with an 
artificial collar that he had inherited from he did not know whom, and waited in the kitchen for 
Fernanda to get her breakfast. The woman of every day, the one with her head held high and with a 
stony gait, did not arrive, but an old woman of supernatural beauty with a yellowed ermine cape, a 
crown of gilded cardboard, and the languid look of a person who wept in secret. Actually, ever since 
she had found it in Aureliano Segundo’s trunks, Fernanda had put on the moth-eaten queen’s dress 
many times. Anyone who could have seen her in front of the mirror, in ecstasy over her own regal 
gestures, would have had reason to think that she was mad. But she was not. She had simply turned 
the royal regalia into a device for her memory. The first time that she put it on she could not help a 
knot from forming in her heart and her eyes filling with tears because at that moment she smelled 
once more the odor of shoe polish on the boots of the officer who came to get her at her house to 
make her a queen, and her soul brightened with the nostalgia of her lost dreams. She felt so old, so 
worn out, so far away from the best moments of her life that she even yearned for those that she 
remembered as the worst, and only then did she discover how much she missed the whiff of 
oregano on the porch and the smell of the roses at dusk, and even the bestial nature of the parvenus. 
Her heart of compressed ash, which had resisted the most telling blows of daily reality without 
strain, fell apart with the first waves of nostalgia. The need to feel sad was becoming a vice as the 
years eroded her. She became human in her solitude. Nevertheless, the morning on which she 
entered the kitchen and found a cup of coffee offered her by a pale and bony adolescent with a 


176

hallucinated glow in his eyes, the claws of ridicule tore at her. Not only did she refuse him 
permission, but from then on she carried the keys to the house in the pocket where she kept the 
unused pessaries. It was a useless precaution because if he had wanted to, Aureliano could have 
escaped and even returned to the house without being seen. But the prolonged captivity, the 
uncertainty of the world, the habit of obedience had dried up the seeds of rebellion in his heart. So 
that he went back to his enclosure, reading and rereading the parchments and listening until very late 
at night to Fernanda sobbing in her bedroom. One morning he went to light the fire as usual and on 
the extinguished ashes he found the food that he had left for her the day before. Then he looked 
into her bedroom and saw her lying on the bed covered with the ermine cape, more beautiful than 
ever and with her skin turned into an ivory casing. Four months later, when Jose Arcadio arrived, he 
found her intact. 

It was impossible to conceive of a man more like his mother. He was wearing a somber taffeta 
suit, a shirt with a round and hard collar, and a thin silk ribbon tied in a bow in place of a necktie. 
He was ruddy and languid with a startled look and weak lips. His black hair, shiny and smooth, 
parted in the middle of his head by a straight and tired line, had the same artificial appearance as the 
hair on the saints. The shadow of a well-uprooted beard on his paraffin face looked like a question 
of conscience. His hands were pale, with green veins and fingers that were like parasites, and he 
wore a solid gold ring with a round sunflower opal on his left index finger. When he opened the 
street door Aureliano did not have to be told who he was to realize that he came from far away. 
With his steps the house filled up with the fragrance of the toilet water that Ursula used to splash on 
him when he was a child in order to find him in the shadows, in some way impossible to ascertain, 
after so many years of absence. Jose Arcadio was still an autumnal child, terribly sad and solitary. He 
went directly to his mother’s bedroom, where Aureliano had boiled mercury for four months in his 
grandfather’s grandfather’s water pipe to conserve the body according to Melquiades’ formula. Jose 
Arcadio did not ask him any questions. He kissed the corpse on the forehead and withdrew from 
under her skirt the pocket of casing which contained three as yet unused pessaries and the key to her 
cabinet. He did everything with direct and decisive movements, in contrast to his languid look. From 
the cabinet he took a small damascene chest with the family crest and found on the inside, which 
was perfumed with sandalwood, the long letter in which Fernanda unburdened her heart of the 
numerous truths that she had hidden from him. He read it standing up, avidly but without anxiety, 
and at the third page he stopped and examined Aureliano with a look of second recognition. 

“So,” he said with a voice with a touch of razor in it, “You’re the bastard.” 

“I’m Aureliano Buendia.” 

“Go to your room,” Jose Arcadio said. 

Aureliano went and did not come out again even from curiosity when he heard the sound of the 
solitary funeral ceremonies. Sometimes, from the kitchen, he would see Jose Arcadio strolling 
through the house, smothered by his anxious breathing, and he continued hearing his steps in the 
ruined bedrooms after midnight. He did not hear his voice for many months, not only because Jose 
Arcadio never addressed him, but also because he had no desire for it to happen or time to think 
about anything else but the parchments. On Fernanda’s death he had taken out the next-to-the-last 
little fish and gone to the wise Catalonian’s bookstore in search of the books he needed. Nothing he 
saw along the way interested him, perhaps because he lacked any memories for comparison and the 
deserted streets and desolate houses were the same as he had imagined them at a time when he 
would have given his soul to know them. He had given himself the permission denied by Fernanda 
and only once and for the minimum time necessary, so without pausing he went along the eleven 
blocks that separated the house from the narrow street where dreams had been interpreted in other 
days and he went panting into the confused and gloomy place where there was barely room to 
move. More than a bookstore, it looked like a dump for used books, which were placed in disorder 


177 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


on the shelves chewed by termites, in the comers sticky with cobwebs, and even in the spaces that 
were supposed to serve as passageways. On a long table, also heaped with old books and papers, the 
proprietor was writing tireless prose in purple letters, somewhat outlandish, and on the loose pages 
of a school notebook. He had a handsome head of silver hair which fell down over his forehead like 
the plume of a cockatoo, and his blue eyes, lively and close-set, revealed the gentleness of a man 
who had read all of the books. He was wearing short pants and soaking in perspiration, and he did 
not stop his writing to see who had come in. Aureliano had no difficulty in rescuing the five books 
that he was looking for from that fabulous disorder, because they were exactly where Melquiades 
had told him they would be. Without saying a word he handed them, along with the little gold fish, 
to the wise Catalonian and the latter examined them, his eyelids contracting like two clams. “You 
must be mad,” he said in his own language, shmgging his shoulders, and he handed back to 
Aureliano the five books and the little fish. 

“You can have them” he said in Spanish. “The last man who read these books must have been 
Isaac the Blindman, so consider well what you’re doing.” 

Jose Arcadio restored Meme’s bedroom and had the velvet curtains cleaned and mended along 
with the damask on the canopy of the viceregal bed, and he put to use once more the abandoned 
bathroom where the cement pool was blackened by a fibrous and rough coating. He restricted his 
vest-pocket empire of worn, exotic clothing, false perfumes, and cheap jewelry to those places. The 
only thing that seemed to wort}? him in the rest of the house were the saints on the family altar, 
which he burned down to ashes one afternoon in a bonfire he lighted in the courtyard. He would 
sleep until past eleven o’clock. He would go to the bathroom in a shabby robe with golden dragons 
on it and a pair of slippers with yellow tassels, and there he would officiate at a rite which for its care 
and length recalled Remedios the Beauty. Before bathing he would perfume the pool with the salts 
that he carried in three alabaster flacons. He did not bathe himself with the gourd but would plunge 
into the fragrant waters and remain there for two hours floating on his back, lulled by the coolness 
and by the memory of Amaranta. A few days after arriving he put aside his taffeta suit, which in 
addition to being too hot for the town was the only one that he had, and he exchanged it for some 
tight-fitting pants very similar to those worn by Pietro Crespi during his dance lessons and a silk 
shirt woven with thread from living caterpillars and with Inis initials embroidered over the heart. 
Twice a week he would wash the complete change in the tub and would wear his robe until it dried 
because he had nothing else to put on. He never ate at home. He would go out when the heat of 
siesta time had eased and would not return until well into the night. Then he would continue his 
anxious pacing, breathing like a cat and thinking about Amaranta. She and the frightful look of the 
saints in the glow of the nocturnal lamp were the two memories he retained of the house. Many 
times during the hallucinating Roman August he had opened his eyes in the middle of his sleep and 
had seen Amaranta rising out of a marble-edged pool with her lace petticoats and the bandage on 
her hand, idealized by the anxiety of exile. Unlike Aureliano Jose who tried to drown that image in 
the bloody bog of war, he tried to keep it alive in the sink of concupiscence while he entertained his 
mother with the endless fable of his pontifical vocation. It never occurred either to him or to 
Fernanda to think that their correspondence was an exchange of fantasies. Jose Arcadio, who left 
the seminary as soon as he reached Rome, continued nourishing the legend of theology and canon 
law so as not to jeopardize the fabulous inheritance of which his mother’s delirious letters spoke and 
which would rescue him from the misery and sordidness he shared with two friends in a Trastevere 
garret. When he received Fernanda’s last letter, dictated by the foreboding of imminent death, he put 
the leftovers of his false splendor into a suitcase and crossed the ocean in the hold of a ship where 
immigrants were crammed together like cattle in a slaughterhouse, eating cold macaroni and wormy 
cheese. Before he read Fernanda’s will, which was nothing but a detailed and tardy recapitulation of 
her misfortunes, the broken-down furniture and the weeds on the porch had indicated that he had 


178 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


fallen into a trap from which he would never escape, exiled forever from the diamond light and 
timeless air of the Roman spring. During the cmshing insomnia brought on by his asthma he would 
measure and remeasure the depth of his misfortune as he went through the shadowy house where 
the senile fussing of Ursula had instilled a fear of the world in him. In order to be sure that she 
would not lose him in the shadows, she had assigned him a corner of the bedroom, the only one 
where he would be safe from the dead people who wandered through the house after sundown. “If 
you do anything bad,” Ursula would tell him, “the saints will let me know.” The terror-filled nights 
of his childhood were reduced to that corner where he would remain motionless until it was time to 
go to bed, perspiring with fear on a stool under the watchful and glacial eyes of the tattletale saints. 
It was useless torture because even at that time he already had a terror of everything around him and 
he was prepared to be frightened at anything he met in life: women on the street, who would ruin 
his blood; the women in the house, who bore children with the tail of a pig; fighting cocks, who 
brought on the death of men and remorse for the rest of one’s life; firearms, which with the mere 
touch would bring down twenty years of war; uncertain ventures, which led only to disillusionment 
and madness—everything, in short, everything that God had created in His infinite goodness and 
that the devil had perverted. When he awakened, pressed in the vise of his nightmares, the light in 
the window and the caresses of Amaranta in the bath and the pleasure of being powdered between 
the legs with a silk puff would release him from the terror. Even Ursula was different under the 
radiant light in the garden because there she did not talk about fearful things but would bmsh his 
teeth with charcoal powder so that he would have the radiant smile of a Pope, and she would cut 
and polish Inis nails so that the pilgrims who came to Rome from all over the world would be 
startled at the beauty of the Pope’s hands as he blessed them, and she would comb his hair like that 
of a Pope, and she would sprinkle his body and his clothing with toilet water so that his body and 
his clothes would have the fragrance of a Pope. In the courtyard of Castel Gandolfo he had seen the 
Pope on a balcony making the same speech in seven languages for a crowd of pilgrims and the only 
thing, indeed, that had drawn his attention was the whiteness of his hands, which seemed to have 
been soaked in lye, the dazzling shine of his summer clothing, and the hidden breath of cologne. 

Almost a year after his return home, having sold the silver candlesticks and the heraldic 
chamberpot—which at the moment of truth turned out to have only a little gold plating on the 
crest—in order to eat, the only distraction of Jose Arcadio was to pick up children in town so that 
they could play in the house. He would appear with them at siesta time and have them skip rope in 
the garden, sing on the porch, and do acrobatics on the furniture in the living room while he would 
go among the groups giving lessons in good manners. At that time he had finished with the tight 
pants and the silk shirts and was wearing an ordinary suit of clothing that he had bought in the Arab 
stores, but he still maintained his languid dignity and his papal air. The children took over the house 
just as Meme’s schoolmates had done in the past. Until well into the night they could be heard 
chattering and singing and tap-dancing, so that the house resembled a boarding school where there 
was no discipline. Aureliano did not worry about the invasion as long as they did not bother him in 
Melquiades’ room. One morning two children pushed open the door and were startled at the sight 
of a filthy and hairy man who was still deciphering the parchments on the worktable. They did not 
dare go in, but they kept on watching the room. They would peep in through the cracks, whispering, 
they threw live animals in through the transom, and on one occasion they nailed up the door and the 
window and it took Aureliano half a day to force them open. Amused at their unpunished mischief, 
four of the children went into the room one morning while Aureliano was in the kitchen, preparing 
to destroy the parchments. But as soon as they laid hands on the yellowed sheets an angelic force 
lifted them off the ground and held them suspended in the air until Aureliano returned and took the 
parchments away from them. From then on they did not bother him. 


179 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


The four oldest children, who wore short pants in spite of the fact that they were on the 
threshold of adolescence, busied themselves with Jose Arcadio’s personal appearance. They would 
arrive earlier than the others and spend the morning shaving him, giving him massages with hot 
towels, cutting and polishing the nails on his hands and feet, and perfuming him with toilet water. 
On several occasions they would get into the pool to soap him from head to toe as he floated on his 
back thinking about Amaranta. Then they would dry him, powder his body, and dress him. One of 
the children, who had curly blond hair and eyes of pink glass like a rabbit, was accustomed to 
sleeping in the house. The bonds that linked him to Jose Arcadio were so strong that he would 
accompany him in his asthmatic insomnia, without speaking, strolling through the house with him in 
the darkness. One night in the room where Ursula had slept they saw a yellow glow coming through 
the crumbling cement as if an underground sun had changed the floor of the room into a pane of 
glass. They did not have to turn on the light. It was sufficient to lift the broken slabs in the corner 
where Ursula’s bed had always stood and where the glow was most intense to find the secret crypt 
that Aureliano Segundo had worn himself out searching for during the delirium of Inis excavations. 
There were the three canvas sacks closed with copper wire, and inside of them the seven thousand 
two hundred fourteen pieces of eight, which continued glowing like embers in the darkness. 

The discovery of the treasure was like a deflagration. Instead of returning to Rome with the 
sudden fortune, which had been Inis dream maturing in misery, Jose Arcadio converted the house 
into a decadent paradise. He replaced the curtains and the canopy of the bed with new velvet, and he 
had the bathroom floor covered with paving stones and the walls with tiles. The cupboard in the 
dining room was filled with fruit preserves, hams, and pickles, and the unused pantry was opened 
again for the storage of wines and liqueurs which Jose Arcadio himself brought from the railroad 
station in crates marked with his name. One night he and the four oldest children had a party' that 
lasted until dawn. At six in the morning they came out naked from the bedroom, drained the pool, 
and filled it with champagne. They jumped in en masse, swimming like birds flying through a sky 
gilded with fragrant bubbles, while Jose Arcadio, floated on his back on the edge of the festivities, 
remembering Amaranta with his eyes open. He remained that way, wrapped up in himself, thinking 
about the bitterness of his equivocal pleasures until after the children had become tired and gone in 
a troop to the bedroom, where they tore down the curtains to dry' themselves, and in the disorder 
they broke the rock crystal mirror into four pieces and destroyed the canopy of the bed in the tumult 
of lying down. When Jose Arcadio came back from the bathroom, he found them sleeping in a 
naked heap in the shipwrecked bedroom. Inflamed, not so much because of the damage as because 
of the disgust and pity that he felt for himself in the emptiness of the saturnalia, he armed himself 
with an ecclesiastical cat-o-nine-tails that he kept in the bottom of his tmnk along with a hair-shirt 
and other instmments of mortification and penance, and drove the children out of the house, 
howling like a madman and whipping them without mercy as a person would not even have done to 
a pack of coyotes. He was done in, with an attack of asthma that lasted for several days and that 
gave him the look of a man on his deathbed. On the third night of torture, overcome by 
asphyxiation, he went to Aureliano’s room to ask him the favor of buying some powders to inhale at 
a nearby dmgstore. So it was that Aureliano, went out for a second time. He had to go only two 
blocks to reach the small pharmacy with dusty windows and ceramic bottles with labels in Latin 
where a girl with the stealthy beauty of a serpent of the Nile gave him the medicine the name of 
which Jose Arcadio had written down on a piece of paper. The second view of the deserted town, 
barely illuminated by the yellowish bulbs of the street lights, did not awaken in Aureliano any more 
curiosity than the first. Jose Arcadio, had come to think that he had mn away, when he reappeared, 
panting a little because of his haste, dragging legs that enclosure and lack of mobility had made weak 
and heavy. His indifference toward the world was so certain that a few days later Jose Arcadio 
violated the promise he had made to his mother and left him free to go out whenever he wanted to. 


180 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


“I have nothing to do outside,” Aureliano answered him. 

He remained shut up, absorbed in the parchments, which he was slowly unraveling and whose 
meaning, nevertheless, he was unable to interpret. Jose Arcadio would bring slices of ham to him in 
his room, sugared flowers which left a spring-like aftertaste in his mouth, and on two occasions a 
glass of fine wine. He was not interested in the parchments, which he thought of more as an esoteric 
pastime, but his attention was attracted by the rare wisdom and the inexplicable knowledge of the 
world that his desolate kinsman had. He discovered then that he could understand written English 
and that between parchments he had gone from the first page to the last of the six volumes of the 
encyclopedia as if it were a novel. At first he attributed to that the fact that Aureliano could speak 
about Rome as if he had lived there many years, but he soon became aware that he knew things that 
were not in the encyclopedia, such as the price of items. “Everything is known,” was the only reply 
he received from Aureliano when he asked him where he had got that information from. Aureliano, 
for his part, was surprised that Jose Arcadio when seen from close by was so different from the 
image that he had formed of him when he saw him wandering through the house. He was capable of 
laughing, of allowing himself from time to time a feeling of nostalgia for the past of the house, and 
of showing concern for the state of misery present in Melquiades’ room. That drawing closer 
together of two solitary people of the same blood was far from friendship, but it did allow them 
both to bear up better under the unfathomable solitude that separated and united them at the same 
time. Jose Arcadio could then turn to Aureliano to untangle certain domestic problems that 
exasperated him. Aureliano, in turn, could sit and read on the porch, waiting for the letters from 
Amaranta Ursula, which still arrived with the usual punctuality, and could use the bathroom, from 
which Jose Arcadio had banished him when he arrived. 

One hot dawn they both woke up in alarm at an urgent knocking on the street door. It was a dark 
old man with large green eyes that gave his face a ghostly phosphorescence and with a cross of ashes 
on his forehead. His clothing in tatters, his shoes cracked, the old knapsack on his shoulder his only 
luggage, he looked like a beggar, but his bearing had a dignity that was in frank contradiction to his 
appearance. It was only necessary to look at him once, even in the shadows of the parlor, to realize 
that the secret strength that allowed him to live was not the instinct of self-preservation but the 
habit of fear. It was Aureliano Amador, the only survivor of Colonel Aureliano Buendia’s seventeen 
sons, searching for a respite in his long and hazardous existence as a fugitive. He identified himself, 
begged them to give him refuge in that house which during his nights as a pariah he had 
remembered as the last redoubt of safety left for him in life. But Jose Arcadio and Aureliano did not 
remember him. Thinking that he was a tramp, they pushed him into the street. They both saw from 
the doorway the end of a drama that had began before Jose Arcadio had reached the age of reason. 
Two policemen who had been chasing Aureliano Amador for years, who had tracked him like 
bloodhounds across half the world, came out from among the almond trees on the opposite 
sidewalk and took two shots with their Mausers which neatly penetrated the cross of ashes. 

Ever since he had expelled the children from the house, Jose Arcadio was really waiting for news 
of an ocean liner that would leave for Naples before Christmas. He had told Aureliano and had even 
made plans to set him up in a business that would bring him a living, because the baskets of food 
had stopped coming since Fernanda’s burial. But that last dream would not be fulfilled either. One 
September morning, after having coffee in the kitchen with Aureliano, Jose Arcadio was finishing 
Inis daily bath when through the openings in the tiles the four children he had expelled from the 
house burst in. Without giving him time to defend himself, they jumped into the pool fully clothed, 
grabbed him by the hair, and held his head under the water until the bubbling of his death throes 
ceased on the surface and Inis silent and pale dolphin body dipped down to the bottom of the 
fragrant water. Then they took out the three sacks of gold from the hiding place which was known 
only to them and their victim. It was such a rapid, methodical, and brutal action that it was like a 


181 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


military operation. Aureliano, shut up in his room, was not aware of anything. That afternoon, hav¬ 
ing missed him in the kitchen, he looked for Jose Arcadio all over the house and found him floating 
on the perfumed mirror of the pool, enormous and bloated and still thinking about Amaranta. Only 
then did he understand how much he had began to love him.

Chapter 19 


AMARANTA URSULA returned with the angels of December, driven on a sailor’s breeze, leading her 
husband by a silk rope tied around his neck. She appeared without warning, wearing an ivory- 
colored dress, a string of pearls that reached almost to her knees, emerald and topaz rings, and with 
her straight hair in a smooth bun held behind her ears by swallow-tail brooches. The man whom she 
had married six months before was a thin, older Fleming with the look of a sailor about him. She 
had only to push open the door to the parlor to realize that her absence had been longer and more 
destructive than she had imagined. 

“Good Lord,” she shouted, more gay than alarmed, “it’s obvious that there’s no woman in this 
house!” 

The baggage would not fit on the porch. Besides Fernanda’s old tmnk, which they had sent her 
off to school with, she had two upright tmnks, four large suitcases, a bag for her parasols, eight 
hatboxes, a gigantic cage with half a hundred canaries, and her husband’s velocipede, broken down 
in a special case which allowed him to carry it like a cello. She did not even take a day of rest after 
the long trip. She put on some worn denim overalls that her husband had brought along with other 
automotive items and set about on a new restoration of the house. She scattered the red ants, who 
had already taken possession of the porch, brought the rose bushes back to life, uprooted the weeds, 
and planted ferns, oregano, and begonias again in the pots along the railing. She took charge of a 
crew of carpenters, locksmiths, and masons, who filled in the cracks in the floor, put doors and 
windows back on their hinges, repaired the furniture, and white-washed the walls inside and out, so 
that three months after her arrival one breathed once more the atmosphere of youth and festivity 
that had existed during the days of the pianola. No one in the house had ever been in a better mood 
at all hours and under any circumstances, nor had anyone ever been readier to sing and dance and 
toss all items and customs from the past into the trash. With a sweep of her broom she did away 
with the funeral mementos and piles of useless trash and articles of superstition that had been piling 
up in the corners, and the only thing she spared, out of gratitude to Ursula, was the daguerreotype of 
Remedios in the parlor. “My, such luxury,” she would shout, dying with laughter. “A fourteen-year- 
old grandmother!” When one of the masons told her that the house was full of apparitions and that 
the only way to drive them out was to look for the treasures they had left buried, she replied amid 
loud laughter that she did not think it was right for men to be superstitious. She was so spontaneous, 
so emancipated, with such a free and modern spirit, that Aureliano did not know what to do with his 
body when he saw her arrive. “My, my!” she shouted happily with open arms. “Look at how my 
darling cannibal has grown!” Before he had a chance to react she had already put a record on the 
portable phonograph she had brought with her and was trying to teach him the latest dance steps. 
She made him change the dirty pants that he had inherited from Colonel Aureliano Buendfa and 
gave him some youthful shirts and two-toned shoes, and she would push him into the street when 
he was spending too much time in Melquiades’ room. 

Active, small, and indomitable like Ursula, and almost as pretty and provocative as Remedios the 
Beauty, she was endowed with a rare instinct for anticipating fashion. When she received pictures of 
the most recent fashions in the mail, they only proved that she had not been wrong about the 
models that she designed herself and sewed on Amaranta’s primitive pedal machine. She subscribed 
to every fashion magazine, art publication, and popular music review published in Europe, and she 
had only to glance at them to realize that things in the world were going just as she imagined they 
were. It was incomprehensible why a woman with that spirit would have returned to a dead town 
burdened by dust and heat, and much less with a husband who had more than enough money to live 


183 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


anywhere in the world and who loved her so much that he let himself be led around by her on a silk 
leash. As time passed, however, her intention to stay was more obvious, because she did not make 
any plans that were not a long way off, nor did she do anything that did not have as an aim the 
search for a comfortable life and a peaceful old age in Macondo. The canary cage showed that those 
aims were made up on the spur of the moment. Remembering that her mother had told her in a 
letter about the extermination of the birds, she had delayed her trip several months until she found a 
ship that stopped at the Fortunate Isles and there she chose the finest twenty-five pairs of canaries 
so that she could repopulate the skies of Macondo. That was the most lamentable of her numerous 
frustrated undertakings. As the birds reproduced Amaranta Ursula would release them in pairs, and 
no sooner did they feel themselves free than they fled the town. She tried in vain to awaken love in 
them by means of the bird cage that Ursula had built during the first reconstruction of the house. 
Also in vain were the artificial nests built of esparto grass in the almond trees and the birdseed 
strewn about the roofs, and arousing the captives so that their songs would dissuade the deserters, 
because they would take flights on their first attempts and make a turn in the sky, just the time 
needed to find the direction to the Fortunate Isles. 

A year after her return, although she had not succeeded in making any friends or giving any 
parties, Amaranta Ursula still believed that it was possible to rescue the community which had been 
singled out by misfortune. Gaston, her husband, took care not to antagonize her, although since that 
fatal noon when he got off the train he realized that his wife’s determination had been provoked by 
a nostalgic mirage. Certain that she would be defeated by the realities, he did not even take the 
trouble to put his velocipede together, but he set about hunting for the largest eggs among the 
spider webs that the masons had knocked down, and he would open them with his fingernails and 
spend hours looking through a magnifying glass at the tiny spiders that emerged. Later on, thinking 
that Amaranta Ursula was continuing with her repairs so that her hands would not be idle, he 
decided to assemble the handsome bicycle, on which the front wheel was much larger than the rear 
one, and he dedicated himself to the capture and curing of every native insect he could find in the 
region, which he sent in jam jars to his former professor of natural history at the University of Liege 
where he had done advanced work in entomology, although his main vocation was that of aviator. 
When he rode the bicycle he would wear acrobat’s tights, gaudy socks, and a Sherlock Holmes cap, 
but when he was on foot he would dress in a spotless natural linen suit, white shoes, a silk bow tie, a 
straw boater, and he would carry a willow stick in his hand. His pale eyes accentuated his look of a 
sailor and his small mustache looked like the fur of a squirrel. Although he was at least fifteen years 
older than his wife, his alert determination to make her happy and his qualities as a good lover 
compensated for the difference. Actually, those who saw that man in his forties with careful habits, 
with the leash around his neck and his circus bicycle, would not have thought that he had made a 
pact of unbridled love with his wife and that they both gave in to the reciprocal drive in the least 
adequate of places and wherever the spirit moved them, as they had done since they had began to 
keep company, and with a passion that the passage of time and the more and more unusual 
circumstances deepened and enriched. Gaston was not only a fierce lover, with endless wisdom and 
imagination, but he was also, perhaps, the first man in the history of the species who had made an 
emergency landing and had come close to killing himself and his sweetheart simply to make love in a 
field of violets. 

They had met two years before they were married, when the sports biplane in which he was 
making rolls over the school where Amaranta Ursula was studying made an intrepid maneuver to 
avoid the flagpole and the primitive framework of canvas and aluminum foil was caught by the tail 
on some electric wires. From then on, paying no attention to his leg in splints, on weekends he 
would pick up Amaranta Ursula at the nun’s boardinghouse where she lived, where the rules were 
not as severe as Fernanda had wanted, and he would take her to his country club. They began to 


184 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


love each other at an altitude of fifteen hundred feet in the Sunday air of the moors, and they felt all 
the closer together as the beings on earth grew more and more minute. She spoke to him of 
Macondo as the brightest and most peaceful town on earth, and of an enormous house, scented 
with oregano, where she wanted to live until old age with a loyal husband and two strong sons who 
would be named Rodrigo and Gonzalo, never Aureliano and Jose Arcadio, and a daughter who 
would be named Virginia and never Remedios. She had evoked the town idealized by nostalgia with 
such strong tenacity that Gaston understood that she would not get married unless he took her to 
live in Macondo. He agreed to it, as he agreed later on to the leash, because he thought it was a 
passing fancy that could be overcome in time. But when two years in Macondo had passed and 
Amaranta Ursula was as happy as on the first day, he began to show signs of alarm. By that time he 
had dissected every dissectible insect in the region, he spoke Spanish like a native, and he had solved 
all of the crossword puzzles in the magazines that he received in the mail. He did not have the 
pretext of climate to hasten their return because nature had endowed him with a colonial liver which 
resisted the drowsiness of siesta time and water that had vinegar worms in it. He liked the native 
cooking so much that once he ate eighty-two iguana eggs at one sitting. Amaranta Ursula, on the 
other hand, had brought in by train fish and shellfish in boxes of ice, canned meats and preserved 
fruits, which were the only things she could eat, and she still dressed in European style and received 
designs by mail in spite of the fact that she had no place to go and no one to visit and by that time 
her husband was not in a mood to appreciate her short skirts, her tilted felt hat, and her seven-strand 
necklaces. Her secret seemed to lie in the fact that she always found a way to keep busy, resolving 
domestic problems that she herself had created, and doing a poor job on a thousand things which 
she would fix on the following day with a pernicious diligence that made one think of Fernanda and 
the hereditary vice of making something just to unmake it. Her festive genius was still so alive then 
that when she received new records she would invite Gaston to stay in the parlor until very late to 
practice the dance steps that her schoolmates described to her in sketches and they would generally 
end up making love on the Viennese rocking chairs or on the bare floor. The only thing that she 
needed to be completely happy was the birth of her children, but she respected the pact she had 
made with her husband not to have any until they had been married for five years. 

Looking for something to fill his idle hours with, Gaston became accustomed to spending the 
morning in Melqufades’ room with the shy Aureliano. He took pleasure in recalling with him the 
most hidden corners of his country, which Aureliano knew as if he had spent much time there. 
When Gaston asked him what he had done to obtain knowledge that was not in the encyclopedia, 
he received the same answer as Jose Arcadio: “Everything Is known.” In addition to Sanskrit he had 
learned English and French and a little Latin and Greek. Since he went out every afternoon at that 
time and Amaranta Ursula had set aside a weekly sum for him for his personal expenses, his room 
looked like a branch of the wise Catalonian’s bookstore. He read avidly until late at night, although 
from the manner in which he referred to his reading, Gaston thought that he did not buy the books 
in order to learn but to verify the tmth of his knowledge, and that none of them interested him 
more than the parchments, to which he dedicated most of his time in the morning. Both Gaston and 
his wife would have liked to incorporate him into the family life, but Aureliano was a hermetic man 
with a cloud of mystery that time was making denser. It was such an unfathomable condition that 
Gaston failed in his efforts to become intimate with him and had to seek other pastimes for his idle 
hours. It was around that time that he conceived the idea of establishing an airmail service. 

It was not a new project. Actually, he had it fairly well advanced when he met Amaranta Ursula, 
except that it was not for Macondo, but for the Belgian Congo, where his family had investments in 
palm oil. The marriage and the decision to spend a few months in Macondo to please his wife had 
obliged him to postpone it. But when he saw that Amaranta Ursula was determined to organize a 
commission for public improvement and even laughed at him when he hinted at the possibility of 


185 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


returning, he understood that things were going to take a long time and he reestablished contact 
with his forgotten partners in Brussels, thinking that it was just as well to be a pioneer in the 
Caribbean as in Africa. While his steps were progressing he prepared a landing field in the old 
enchanted region which at that time looked like a plain of crushed flintstone, and he studied the 
wind direction, the geography of the coastal region, and the best routes for aerial navigation, without 
knowing that his diligence, so similar to that of Mr. Herbert, was filling the town with the dangerous 
suspicion that his plan was not to set up routes but to plant banana trees. Enthusiastic over the idea 
that, after all, might justify his permanent establishment in Macondo, he took several trips to the 
capital of the province, met with authorities, obtained licenses, and drew up contracts for exclusive 
rights. In the meantime he maintained a correspondence with his partners in Brussels which 
resembled that of Fernanda with the invisible doctors, and he finally convinced them to ship the 
first airplane under the care of an expert mechanic, who would assemble it in the nearest port and 
fly it to Macondo. One year after his first meditations and meteorological calculations, trusting in the 
repeated promises of his correspondents, he had acquired the habit of strolling through the streets, 
looking at the sky, hanging onto the sound of the breeze in hopes that the airplane would appear. 

Although she had not noticed it, the return of Amaranta Ursula had brought on a radical change 
in Aureliano’s life. After the death of Jose Arcadio he had become a regular customer at the wise 
Catalonian’s bookstore. Also, the freedom that he enjoyed then and the time at his disposal awoke in 
him a certain curiosity about the town, which he came to know without any surprise. He went 
through the dusty and solitary streets, examining with scientific interest the inside of houses in min, 
the metal screens on the windows broken by mst and the dying birds, and the inhabitants bowed 
down by memories. He tried to reconstruct in his imagination the annihilated splendor of the old 
banana-company town, whose dry swimming pool was filled to the brim with rotting men’s and 
women’s shoes, and in the houses of which, destroyed by rye grass, he found the skeleton of a 
German shepherd dog still tied to a ring by a steel chain and a telephone that was ringing, ringing, 
ringing until he picked it up and an anguished and distant woman spoke in English, and he said yes, 
that the strike was over, that three thousand dead people had been thrown into the sea, that the 
banana company had left, and that Macondo finally had peace after many years. Those wanderings 
led him to the prostrate red-light district, where in other times bundles of banknotes had been 
burned to liven up the revels, and which at that time was a maze of streets more afflicted and 
miserable than the others, with a few red lights still burning and with deserted dance halls adorned 
with the remnants of wreaths, where the pale, fat widows of no one, the French great-grandmothers 
and the Babylonian matriarchs, were still waiting beside their photographs. Aureliano could not find 
anyone who remembered his family, not even Colonel Aureliano Buendia, except for the oldest of 
the West Indian Negroes, an old man whose cottony hair gave him the look of a photographic nega¬ 
tive and who was still singing the mournful sunset psalms in the door of his house. Aureliano would 
talk to him in the tortured Papiamento that he had learned in a few weeks and sometimes he would 
share his chicken-head soup, prepared by the great-granddaughter, with him. She was a large black 
woman with solid bones, the hips of a mare, teats like live melons, and a round and perfect head 
armored with a hard surface of wiry hair which looked like a medieval warrior’s mail headdress. Her 
name was Nigromanta. In those days Aureliano lived off the sale of silverware, candlesticks, and 
other bric-a-brac from the house. When he was penniless, which was most of the time, he got 
people in the back of the market to give him the chicken heads that they were going to throw away 
and he would take them to Nigromanta to make her soups, fortified with purslane and seasoned 
with mint. When the great-grandfather died Aureliano stopped going by the house, but he would run 
into Nigromanta under the dark almond trees on the square, using her wild-animal whistles to lure 
the few night owls. Many times he stayed with her, speaking in Papiamento about chicken-head soup 
and other dainties of misery, and he would have kept right on if she had not let him know that his 


186 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


presence frightened off customers. Although he sometimes felt the temptation and although 
Nigromanta herself might have seemed to him as the natural culmination of a shared nostalgia, he 
did not go to bed with her. So Aureliano was still a virgin when Amaranta Ursula returned to 
Macondo and gave him a sisterly embrace that left him breathless. Every time he saw her, and worse 
yet when she showed him the latest dances, he felt the same spongy release in his bones that had 
disturbed his great-great-grandfather when Pilar Ternera made her pretexts about the cards in the 
granary. Trying to squelch the torment, he sank deeper into the parchments and eluded the innocent 
flattery of that aunt who was poisoning his nights with a flow of tribulation, but the more he 
avoided her the more the anxiety with which he waited for her stony laughter, her howls of a happy 
cat, and her songs of gratitude, agonizing in love at all hours and in the most unlikely parts of the 
house. One night thirty feet from his bed, on the silver workbench, the couple with unhinged bellies 
broke the bottles and ended up making love in a pool of muriatic acid. Aureliano not only could not 
sleep for a single second, but he spent the next day with a fever, sobbing with rage. The first night 
that he waited for Nigromanta to come to the shadows of the almond trees it seemed like an 
eternity, pricked as he was by the needles of uncertainty and clutching in his fist the peso and fifty 
cents that he had asked Amaranta Ursula for, not so much because he needed it as to involve her, 
debase her, prostitute her in his adventure in some way. Nigromanta took him to her room, which 
was lighted with false candlesticks, to her folding cot with the bedding stained from bad loves, and 
to her body of a wild dog, hardened and without soul, which prepared itself to dismiss him as if he 
were a frightened child, and suddenly it found a man whose tremendous power demanded a 
movement of seismic readjustment from her insides. 

They became lovers. Aureliano would spend his mornings deciphering parchments and at siesta 
time he would go to the bedroom where Nigromanta was waiting for him, to teach him first how to 
do it like earthworms, then like snails, and finally like crabs, until she had to leave him and lie in wait 
for vagabond loves. Several weeks passed before Aureliano discovered that around her waist she 
wore a small belt that seemed to be made out of a cello string, but which was hard as steel and had 
no end, as if it had been born and grown with her. Almost always, between loves, they would eat 
naked in the bed, in the hallucinating heat and under the daytime stars that the mst had caused to 
shine on the zinc ceiling. It was the first time that Nigromanta had had a steady man, a bone cmsher 
from head to toe, as she herself said, dying with laughter, and she had even begun to get romantic 
illusions when Aureliano confided in her about his repressed passion for Amaranta Ursula, which he 
had not been able to cure with the substitution but which was twisting him inside all the more as 
experience broadened the horizons of love. After that Nigromanta continued to receive him with 
the same warmth as ever but she made him pay for her services so strictly that when Aureliano had 
no money she would make an addition to his bill, which was not figured in numbers but by marks 
that she made with her thumbnail behind the door. At sundown, while she was drifting through the 
shadows in the square, Aureliano, was going along the porch like a stranger, scarcely greeting 
Amaranta Ursula and Gaston, who usually dined at that time, and shutting herself up in his room 
again, unable to read or write or even think because of the anxiety brought on by the laughter, the 
whispering, the preliminary frolics, and then the explosions of agonizing happiness that capped the 
nights in the house. That was his life two years before Gaston began to wait for the airplane, and it 
went on the same way on the afternoon that he went to the bookstore of the wise Catalonian and 
found four ranting boys in a heated argument about the methods used to kill cockroaches in the 
Middle Ages. The old bookseller, knowing about Aureliano’s love for books that had been read only 
by the Venerable Bede, urged him with a certain fatherly malice to get into the discussion, and 
without even taking a breath, he explained that the cockroach, the oldest winged insect on the face 
of the earth, had already been the victim of slippers in the Old Testament, but that since the species 
was definitely resistant to any and all methods of extermination, from tomato dices with borax to 


187 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


flour and sugar, and with its one thousand six hundred three varieties had resisted the most ancient, 
tenacious, and pitiless persecution that mankind had unleashed against any living thing since the 
beginnings, including man himself, to such an extent that just as an instinct for reproduction was at¬ 
tributed to humankind, so there must have been another one more definite and pressing, which was 
the instinct to kill cockroaches, and if the latter had succeeded in escaping human ferocity it was 
because they had taken refuge in the shadows, where they became invulnerable because of man’s 
congenital fear of the dark, but on the other hand they became susceptible to the glow of noon, so 
that by the Middle Ages already, and in present times, and per omnia secula seculomm , the only effective 
method for killing cockroaches was the glare of the sun. 

That encyclopedic coincidence was the beginning of a great friendship. Aureliano continued 
getting together in the afternoon with the four arguers, whose names were Alvaro, German, 
Alfonso, and Gabriel, the first and last friends that he ever had in his life. For a man like him, holed 
up in written reality, those stormy sessions that began in the bookstore and ended at dawn in the 
brothels were a revelation. It had never occurred to him until then to think that literature was the 
best plaything that had ever been invented to make fun of people, as Alvaro demonstrated during 
one night of revels. Some time would have to pass before Aureliano realized that such arbitrary 
attitudes had their origins in the example of the wise Catalonian, for whom wisdom was worth 
nothing if it could not be used to invent a way of preparing chick peas. 

The afternoon on which Aureliano gave his lecture on cockroaches, the argument ended up in 
the house of the girls who went to bed because of hunger, a brothel of lies on the outskirts of 
Macondo. The proprietress was a smiling mamasanta , tormented by a mania for opening and closing 
doors. Her eternal smile seemed to have been brought on by the credulity of her customers, who 
accepted as something certain an establishment that did not exist except in the imagination, because 
even the tangible things there were unreal: the furniture that fell apart when one sat on it, the 
disemboweled phonograph with a nesting hen inside, the garden of paper flowers, the calendars 
going back to the years before the arrival of the banana company, the frames with prints cut out of 
magazines that had never been published. Even the timid little whores who came from the neigh¬ 
borhood: when the proprietress informed them that customers had arrived they were nothing but an 
invention. They would appear without any greeting in their little flowered dresses left over from days 
when they were five years younger, and they took them off with the same innocence with which they 
had put them on, and in the paroxysms of love they would exclaim good heavens, look how that 
roof is falling in, and as soon as they got their peso and fifty cents they would spend it on a roll with 
cheese that the proprietress sold them, smiling more than ever, because only she knew that that meal 
was not true either. Aureliano, whose world at that time began with Melquiades’ parchments and 
ended in Nigromanta’s bed, found a stupid cure for timidity in the small imaginary brothel. At first 
he could get nowhere, in rooms where the proprietress would enter during the best moments of love 
and make all sorts of comments about the intimate charms of the protagonists. But with time he 
began to get so familiar with those misfortunes of the world that on one night that was more 
unbalanced than the others he got undressed in the small reception room and ran through the house 
balancing a bottle of beer on his inconceivable maleness. He was the one who made fashionable the 
extravagances that the proprietress celebrated with her eternal smile, without protesting, without 
believing in them just as when German tried to burn the house down to show that it did not exist, 
and as when Alfonso wrung the neck of the parrot and threw it into the pot where the chicken stew 
was beginning to boil. 

Although Aureliano felt himself linked to the four friends by a common affection and a common 
solidarity, even to the point where he thought of them as if they were one person, he was closer to 
Gabriel than to the others. The link was born on the night when he casually mentioned Colonel 
Aureliano Buendia and Gabriel was the only one who did not think that he was making fun of 


188 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


somebody. Even the proprietress, who normally did not take part in the conversation argued with a 
madam’s wrathful passion that Colonel Aureliano Buendla, of whom she had indeed heard speak at 
some time, was a figure invented by the government as a pretext for killing Liberals. Gabriel, on the 
other hand, did not doubt the reality of Colonel Aureliano Buendia because he had been a 
companion in arms and inseparable friend of his great-great-grandfather Colonel Gerineldo 
Marquez. Those fickle tricks of memory were even more critical when the killing of the workers was 
brought up. Every time that Aureliano mentioned the matter, not only the proprietress but some 
people older than she would repudiate the myth of the workers hemmed in at the station and the 
train with two hundred cars loaded with dead people, and they would even insist that, after all, 
everything had been set forth in judicial documents and in primary-school textbooks: that the 
banana company had never existed. So that Aureliano and Gabriel were linked by a kind of complic¬ 
ity based on real facts that no one believed in, and which had affected their lives to the point that 
both of them found themselves off course in the tide of a world that had ended and of which only 
the nostalgia remained. Gabriel would sleep wherever time overtook him. Aureliano put him up 
several times in the silver workshop, but he would spend his nights awake, disturbed by the noise of 
the dead people who walked through the bedrooms until dawn. Later he turned him over to 
Nigromanta, who took him to her well-used room when she was free and put down his account with 
vertical marks behind the door in the few spaces left free by Aureliano’s debts. 

In spite of their disordered life, the whole group tried to do something permanent at the urging 
of the wise Catalonian. It was he, with his experience as a former professor of classical literature and 
his storehouse of rare books, who got them to spend a whole night in search of the thirty-seventh 
dramatic situation in a town where no one had any interest any more in going beyond primary 
school. Fascinated by the discovery of friendship, bewildered by the enchantments of a world which 
had been forbidden to him by Fernanda’s meanness, Aureliano abandoned the scmtiny of the 
parchments precisely when they were beginning to reveal themselves as predictions in coded lines of 
poetry. But the subsequent proof that there was time enough for everything without having to give 
up the brothels gave him the drive to return to Melquiades’ room, having decided not to flag in his 
efforts until he had discovered the last keys. That was during the time that Gaston began to wait for 
the airplane and Amaranta Ursula was so lonely that one morning she appeared in the room. 

“Hello, cannibal,” she said to him. “Back in your cave again?” 

She was irresistible, with a dress she had designed and one of the long shad-vertebra necklaces 
that she herself had made. She had stopped using the leash, convinced of her husband’s faithfulness, 
and for the first time since her return she seemed to have a moment of ease. Aureliano did not need 
to see her to know that she had arrived. She put her elbows on the table, so close and so helpless 
that Aureliano heard the deep sound of her bones, and she became interested in the parchments. 
Trying to overcome his disturbance, he grasped at the voice that he was losing, the life that was 
leaving him, the memory that was turning into a petrified polyp, and he spoke to her about the 
priestly destiny of Sanskrit, the scientific possibility of seeing the future showing through in time as 
one sees what is written on the back of a sheet of paper through the light, the necessity of 
deciphering the predictions so that they would not defeat themselves, and the Centuries of 
Nostradamus and the destruction of Cantabria predicted by Saint Milanus. Suddenly, without 
interrupting the chat, moved by an impulse that had been sleeping in him since his origins, 
Aureliano put his hand on hers, thinking that that final decision would put an end to Iris doubts. She 
grabbed his index finger with the affectionate innocence with which she had done so in childhood, 
however, and she held it while he kept on answering questions. They remained like that, linked by 
icy index fingers that did not transmit anything in any way until she awoke from her momentary 
dream and slapped her forehead with her hand. “The ants!” she exclaimed. And then she forgot 
about the manuscripts, went to the door with a dance step, and from there she threw Aureliano a 


189 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


kiss with the tips of her fingers as she had said good-bye to her father on the afternoon when they 
sent her to Brussels. 

“You can tell me later,” she said. “I forgot that today’s the day to put quicklime on the anthills.” 

She continued going to the room occasionally when she had something to do in that part of the 
house and she would stay there for a few minutes while her husband continued to scrutinize the sky. 
Encouraged by that change, Aureliano stayed to eat with the family at that time as he had not done 
since the first months of Amaranta Ursula’s return. Gaston was pleased. During the conversations 
after meals, which usually went on for more than an hour, he complained that his partners were 
deceiving him. They had informed him of the loading of the airplane on board a ship that did not 
arrive, and although his shipping agents insisted, that it would never arrive because it was not on the 
list of Caribbean ships, his partners insisted that the shipment was correct and they even insinuated 
that Gaston was lying to them in his letters. The correspondence reached such a degree of mutual 
suspicion that Gaston decided not to write again and he began to suggest the possibility of a quick 
trip to Brussels to clear things up and return with the airplane. The plan evaporated, however, as 
soon as Amaranta Ursula reiterated her decision not to move from Macondo even if she lost a 
husband. During the first days Aureliano shared the general opinion that Gaston was a fool on a 
velocipede, and that brought on a vague feeling of pity. Later, when he obtained deeper information 
on the nature of men in the brothels, he thought that Gaston’s meekness had its origins in unbridled 
passion. But when he came to know him better and realized his tme character was the opposite of 
his submissive conduct, he conceived the malicious suspicion that even the wait for the airplane was 
an act. Then he thought that Gaston was not as foolish as he appeared, but, quite the contrary, was a 
man of infinite steadiness, ability, and patience who had set about to conquer his wife with the 
weariness of eternal agreement, of never saying no, of simulating a limitless conformity, letting her 
become enmeshed in her own web until the day she could no longer bear the tedium of the illusions 
close at hand and would pack the bags herself to go back to Europe. Aureliano’s former pity turned 
into a violent dislike. Gaston’s system seemed so perverse to him, but at the same time so effective, 
that he ventured to warn Amaranta Ursula. She made fun of his suspicions, however, without even 
noticing the heavyweight of love, uncertainty, and jealousy that he had inside. It had not occurred to 
her that she was arousing something more than fraternal affection in Aureliano until she pricked her 
finger trying to open a can of peaches and he dashed over to suck the blood out with an avidity and 
a devotion that sent a chill up her spine. 

“Aureliano!” She laughed, disturbed. “You’re too suspicious to be a good bat.” 

Then Aureliano went all out. Giving her some small, orphaned kisses in the hollow of her 
wounded hand, he opened up the most hidden passageways of his heart and drew out an 
interminable and lacerated intestine, the terrible parasitic animal that had incubated in his mar¬ 
tyrdom. He told her how he would get up at midnight to weep in loneliness and rage over the 
underwear that she had left to dry in the bathroom. He told her about the anxiety with which he had 
asked Nigromanta to howl like a cat and sob gaston gaston gaston in his ear, and with how much 
astuteness he had ransacked her vials of perfume so that he could smell it on the necks of the little 
girls who went to bed because of hunger. Frightened by the passion of that outburst, Amaranta 
Ursula was closing her fingers, contracting them like a shellfish until her wounded hand, free of all 
pain and any vestige of pity, was converted into a knot of emeralds and topazes and stony and 
unfeeling bones. 

“Fool!” she said as if she were spitting. “I’m sailing on the first ship leaving for Belgium.” 

Alvaro had come to the wise Catalonian’s bookstore one of those afternoons proclaiming at the 
top of his lungs his latest discovery: a zoological brothel. It was called The Golden Child and it was 
a huge open air salon through which no less than two hundred bitterns who told the time with a 
deafening cackling strolled at will. In wire pens that surrounded the dance floor and among large 


190 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


Amazonian camellias there were herons of different colors, crocodiles as fat as pigs, snakes with 
twelve rattles, and a turtle with a gilded shell who dove in a small artificial ocean. There was a big 
white dog, meek and a pederast, who would give stud services nevertheless in order to be fed. The 
atmosphere had an innocent denseness, as if it had just been created, and the beautiful mulatto girls 
who waited hopelessly among the blood-red petals and the outmoded phonograph records knew 
ways of love that man had left behind forgotten in the earthly paradise. The first night that the 
group visited that greenhouse of illusions the splendid and taciturn old woman who guarded the 
entrance in a wicker rocking chair felt that time was turning back to its earliest origins when among 
the five who were arriving she saw a bony, jaundiced man with Tartar cheekbones, marked forever 
and from the beginning of the world with the pox of solitude. 

“Lord, Lord,” she sighed, “Aureliano!” 

She was seeing Colonel Aureliano Buendia once more as she had seen him in the light of a lamp 
long before the wars, long before the desolation of glory and the exile of disillusionment, that 
remote dawn when he went to her bedroom to give the first command of his life: the command to 
give him love. It was Pilar Ternera. Years before, when she had reached one hundred forty-five years 
of age, she had given up the pernicious custom of keeping track of her age and she went on living in 
the static and marginal time of memories, in a future perfectly revealed and established, beyond the 
futures disturbed by the insidious snares and suppositions of her cards. 

From that night on Aureliano, took refuge in the compassionate tenderness and understanding of 
his unknown great-great-grandmother. Sitting in her wicker rocking chair, she would recall the past, 
reconstmct the grandeur and misfortunes of the family and the splendor of Macondo, which was 
now erased, while Alvaro frightened the crocodiles with his noisy laughter and Alfonso invented 
outlandish stories about the bitterns who had pecked out the eyes of four customers who 
misbehaved the week before, and Gabriel was in the room of the pensive mulatto girl who did not 
collect in money but in letters to a smuggler boyfriend who was in prison on the other side of the 
Orinoco because the border guards had caught him and had made him sit on a chamberpot that 
filled up with a mixture of shit and diamonds. That true brothel, with that maternal proprietress, was 
the world of which Aureliano had dreamed during his prolonged captivity. He felt so well, so close 
to perfect companionship, that he thought of no other refuge on the afternoon on which Amaranta 
Ursula had made his illusions crumble. He was ready to unburden himself with words so that 
someone could break the knots that bound his chest, but he only managed to let out a fluid, warm, 
and restorative weeping in Pilar Ternera’s lap. She let him finish, scratching his head with the tips of 
her fingers, and without his having revealed that he was weeping from love, she recognized 
immediately the oldest sobs in the history of man. 

“It’s all right, child,” she consoled him. “Now tell me who it is.” 

When Aureliano told her, Pilar Ternera let out a deep laugh, the old expansive laugh that ended 
up as a cooing of doves. There was no mystery in the heart of a Buendia that was impenetrable for 
her because a century of cards and experience had taught her that the history of the family was a 
machine with unavoidable repetitions, a turning wheel that would have gone on spilling into eternity 
were it not for the progressive and irremediable wearing of the axle. 

“Don’t worry,” she said, smiling. “Wherever she is right now, she’s waiting for you.” 

It was half past four in the afternoon when Amaranta Ursula came out of her bath. Aureliano 
saw her go by his room with a robe of soft folds and a towel wrapped around her head like a turban. 
He followed her almost on tiptoes, stumbling from dmnkenness, and he went into the nuptial 
bedroom just as she opened the robe and closed it again in fright. He made a silent signal toward the 
next room where the door was half open and where Aureliano knew that Gaston was beginning to 
write a letter. 

“Go away,” she said voicelessly. 


191 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


Aureliano, smiled, picked her up by the waist with both hands like a pot of begonias, and 
dropped her on her back on the bed. With a brutal tug he pulled off her bathrobe before she had 
time to resist and he loomed over an abyss of newly washed nudity whose skin color, lines of fuzz, 
and hidden moles had all been imagined in the shadows of the other rooms. Amaranta Ursula 
defended herself sincerely with the astuteness of a wise woman, weaseling her slippery, flexible, and 
fragrant weasel’s body as she tried to knee him in the kidneys and scorpion his face with her nails, 
but without either of them giving a gasp that might not have been taken for that breathing of a 
person watching the meager April sunset through the open window. It was a fierce fight, a battle to 
the death, but it seemed to be without violence because it consisted of distorted attacks and ghostly 
evasions, slow, cautious, solemn, so that during it all there was time for the petunias to bloom and 
for Gaston to forget about his aviator’s dream in the next room, as if they were two enemy lovers 
seeking reconciliation at the bottom of an aquarium. In the heat of that savage and ceremonious 
struggle, Amaranta Ursula understood that her meticulous silence was so irrational that it could 
awaken the suspicions of her nearby husband much more than the sound of warfare that they were 
trying to avoid. Then she began to laugh with her lips tight together, without giving up the fight, but 
defending herself with false bites and deweaseling her body little by little until they both were 
conscious of being adversaries and accomplices at the same time and the affray degenerated into a 
conventional gambol and the attacks became caresses. Suddenly, almost playfully, like one more bit 
of mischief, Amaranta Ursula dropped her defense, and when she tried to recover, frightened by 
what she herself had made possible, it was too late. A great commotion immobilized her in her 
center of gravity, planted her in her place, and her defensive will was demolished by the irresistible 
anxiety to discover what the orange whistles and the invisible globes on the other side of death were 
like. She barely had time to reach out her hand and grope for the towel to put a gag between her 
teeth so that she would not let out the cat howls that were already tearing at her insides.

Chapter 20 


PILAR TERNERA died in her wicker rocking chair during one night of festivities as she watched over 
the entrance to her paradise. In accordance with her last wishes she was not buried in a coffin but 
sitting in her rocker, which eight men lowered by ropes into a huge hole dug in the center of the 
dance floor. The mulatto girls, dressed in black, pale from weeping, invented shadowy rites as they 
took off their earrings, brooches, and rings and threw them into the pit before it was closed over 
with a slab that bore neither name nor dates, and that was covered with a pile of Amazonian 
camellias. After poisoning the animals they closed up the doors and windows with brick and mortar 
and they scattered out into the world with their wooden trunks that were lined with pictures of 
saints, prints from magazines, and the portraits of sometime sweethearts, remote and fantastic, who 
shat diamonds, or ate cannibals, or were crowned playing-card kings on the high seas. 

It was the end. In Pilar Ternera’s tomb, among the psalm and cheap whore jewelry, the ruins of 
the past would rot, the little that remained after the wise Catalonian had auctioned off his bookstore 
and returned to the Mediterranean village where he had been born, overcome by a yearning for a 
lasting springtime. No one could have foreseen his decision. He had arrived in Macondo during the 
splendor of the banana company, fleeing from one of many wars, and nothing more practical had 
occurred to him than to set up that bookshop of incunabula and first editions in several languages, 
which casual customers would thumb through cautiously, as if they were junk books, as they waited 
their turn to have their dreams interpreted in the house across the way. He spent half his life in the 
back of the store, scribbling in his extra-careful hand in purple ink and on pages that he tore out of 
school notebooks, and no one was sure exactly what he was writing. When Aureliano first met him 
he had two boxes of those motley pages that in some way made one think of Melquiades’ 
parchments, and from that time until he left he had filled a third one, so it was reasonable to believe 
that he had done nothing else during his stay in Macondo. The only people with whom he 
maintained relations were the four friends, whom he had exchanged their tops and kites for books, 
and he set them to reading Seneca and Ovid while they were still in grammar school. He treated the 
classical writers with a household familiarity, as if they had all been his roommates at some period, 
and he knew many tilings that should not have been known, such as the fact that Saint Augustine 
wore a wool jacket under his habit that he did not take off for fourteen years and that Arnaldo of 
Villanova, the necromancer, was impotent since childhood because of a scorpion bite. His fervor for 
the written word was an interweaving of solemn respect and gossipy irreverence. Not even his own 
manuscripts were safe from that dualism. Having learned Catalan in order to translate them, Alfonso 
put a roll of pages in his pockets, which were always full of newspaper clippings and manuals for 
strange trades, and one night he lost them in the house of the little girls who went to bed because of 
hunger. When the wise old grandfather found out, instead of raising a row as had been feared, he 
commented, dying with laughter, that it was the natural destiny of literature. On the other hand, 
there was no human power capable of persuading him not to take along the three boxes when he 
returned to his native village, and he unleashed a string of Carthaginian curses at the railroad 
inspectors who tried to ship them as freight until he finally succeeded in keeping them with him in 
the passenger coach. “The world must be all fucked up,” he said then, “when men travel first class 
and literature goes as freight.” That was the last tiling he was heard to say. He had spent a dark week 
on the final preparations for the trip, because as the hour approached his humor was breaking down 
and things began to be misplaced, and what he put in one place would appear in another, attacked 
by the same elves that had tormented Fernanda. 

“ Collons ,” he would curse. “I shit on Canon Twenty-seven of the Synod of London.”

German and Aureliano took care of him. They helped him like a child, fastening Inis tickets and 
immigration documents to his pockets with safety pins, making him a detailed list of what he must 
do from the time he left Macondo until he landed in Barcelona, but nonetheless he threw away a 
pair of pants with half of Inis money in it without realizing it. The night before the trip, after nailing 
up the boxes and putting his clothing into the same suitcase that he had brought when he first came, 
he narrowed his clam eyes, pointed with a kind of impudent benediction at the stacks of books with 
which he had endured during his exile, and said to Inis friends: 

“All that shit there I leave to you people!” 

Three months later they received in a large envelope twenty-nine letters and more than fifty 
pictures that he had accumulated during the leisure of the high seas. Although he did not date them, 
the order in which he had written the letters was obvious. In the first ones, with his customary good 
humor, he spoke about the difficulties of the crossing, the urge he had to throw the cargo officer 
overboard when he would not let him keep the three boxes in his cabin, the clear imbecility of a lady 
who was terrified at the number thirteen, not out of superstition but because she thought it was a 
number that had no end, and the bet that he had won during the first dinner because he had 
recognized in the drinking water on board the taste of the nighttime beets by the springs of Lerida. 
With the passage of the days, however, the reality of life on board mattered less and less to him and 
even the most recent and trivial happenings seemed worthy of nostalgia, because as the ship got 
farther away, his memory began to grow sad. That process of nostalgia was also evident in the 
pictures. In the first ones he looked happy, with his sport shirt which looked like a hospital jacket 
and his snowy mane, in an October Caribbean filled with whitecaps. In the last ones he could be 
seen to be wearing a dark coat and a milk scarf, pale in the face, taciturn from absence on the deck 
of a mournful ship that had come to be like a sleepwalker on the autumnal seas. German and Aureli¬ 
ano answered his letters. He wrote so many during the first months that at that time they felt closer 
to him than when he had been in Macondo, and they were almost freed from the rancor that he had 
left behind. At first he told them that everything was just the same, that the pink snails were still in 
the house where he had been born, that the dry herring still had the same taste on a piece of toast, 
that the waterfalls in the village still took on a perfumed smell at dusk. They were the notebook 
pages again, woven with the purple scribbling, in which he dedicated a special paragraph to each 
one. Nevertheless, and although he himself did not seem to notice it, those letters of recuperation 
and stimulation were slowly changing into pastoral letters of disenchantment. One winter night 
while the soup was boiling in the fireplace, he missed the heat of the back of his store, the buzzing 
of the sun on the dusty almond trees, the whistle of the train during the lethargy of siesta time, just 
as in Macondo he had missed the winter soup in the fireplace, the cries of the coffee vendor, and the 
fleeting larks of springtime. Upset by two nostalgias facing each other like two mirrors, he lost his 
marvelous sense of unreality and he ended up recommending to all of them that they leave 
Macondo, that they forget everything he had taught them about the world and the human heart, that 
they shit on Horace, and that wherever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, 
that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest 
and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end. 

Alvaro was the first to take the advice to abandon Macondo. He sold everything, even the tame 
jaguar that teased passersby from the courtyard of his house, and he bought an eternal ticket on a 
train that never stopped traveling. In the postcards that he sent from the way stations he would 
describe with shouts the instantaneous images that he had seen from the window of his coach, and it 
was as if he were tearing up and throwing into oblivion some long, evanescent poem: the chimerical 
Negroes in the cotton fields of Louisiana, the winged horses in the bluegrass of Kentucky, the 
Greek lovers in the infernal sunsets of Arizona, the girl in the red sweater painting watercolors by a 
lake in Michigan who waved at him with her bmshes, not to say farewell but out of hope, because 


194

she did not know that she was watching a train with no return passing by. Then Alfonso and 
German left one Saturday with the idea of coming back on Monday, but nothing more was ever 
heard of them. A year after the departure of the wise Catalonian the only one left in Macondo was 
Gabriel, still adrift at the mercy of Nigromanta’s chancy charity and answering the questions of a 
contest in a French magazine in which the first prize was a trip to Paris. Aureliano, who was the one 
who subscribed to it, helped him fill in the answers, sometimes in his house but most of the time 
among the ceramic bottles and atmosphere of valerian in the only pharmacy left in Macondo, where 
Mercedes, Gabriel’s stealthy girl friend, lived. It was the last that remained of a past whose 
annihilation had not taken place because it was still in a process of annihilation, consuming itself 
from within, ending at every moment but never ending its ending. The town had reached such 
extremes of inactivity that when Gabriel won the contest and left for Paris with two changes of 
clothing, a pair of shoes, and the complete works of Rabelais, he had to signal the engineer to stop 
the train and pick him up. The old Street of the Turks was at that time an abandoned corner where 
the last Arabs were letting themselves be dragged off to death with the age-old custom of sitting in 
their doorways, although it had been many years since they had sold the last yard of diagonal cloth, 
and in the shadowy showcases only the decapitated manikins remained. The banana company’s city, 
which Patricia Brown may have tried to evoke for her grandchildren during the nights of intolerance 
and dill pickles in Prattville, Alabama, was a plain of wild grass. The ancient priest who had taken 
Father Angel’s place and whose name no one had bothered to find out awaited God’s mercy 
stretched out casually in a hammock, tortured by arthritis and the insomnia of doubt while the 
lizards and rats fought over the inheritance of the nearby church. In that Macondo forgotten even 
by the birds, where the dust and the heat had become so strong that it was difficult to breathe, 
secluded by solitude and love and by the solitude of love in a house where it was almost impossible 
to sleep because of the noise of the red ants, Aureliano, and Amaranta Ursula were the only happy 
beings, and the most happy on the face of the earth. 

Gaston had returned to Brussels. Tired of waiting for the airplane, one day he put his 
indispensable things into a small suitcase, took his file of correspondence, and left with the idea of 
returning by air before his concession was turned over to a group of German pilots who had 
presented the provincial authorities with a more ambitious project than his. Since the afternoon of 
their first love, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula had continued taking advantage of her husband’s 
rare unguarded moments, making love with gagged ardor in chance meetings and almost always 
intermpted by unexpected returns. But when they saw themselves alone in the house they 
succumbed to the delirium of lovers who were making up for lost time. It was a mad passion, 
unhinging, which made Fernanda’s bones tremble with horror in her grave and which kept them in a 
state of perpetual excitement. Amaranta Ursula’s shrieks, her songs of agony would break out the 
same at two in the afternoon on the dining-room table as at two in the morning in the pantry. “What 
hurts me most,” she would say, laughing, “is all the time that we wasted.” In the bewilderment of 
passion she watched the ants devastating the garden, sating their prehistoric hunger with the beam 
of the house, and she watched the torrents of living lava take over the porch again, but she bothered 
to fight them only when she found them in her bedroom. Aureliano abandoned the parchments, did 
not leave the house again, and carelessly answered the letters from the wise Catalonian. They lost 
their sense of reality, the notion of time, the rhythm of daily habits. They closed the doors and 
windows again so as not to waste time getting undressed and they walked about the house as 
Remedios the Beauty had wanted to do and they would roll around naked in the mud of the 
courtyard, and one afternoon they almost drowned as they made love in the cistern. In a short time 
they did more damage than the red ants: they destroyed the furniture in the parlor, in their madness 
they tore to shreds the hammock that had resisted the sad bivouac loves of Colonel Aureliano 
Buendfa and they disemboweled the mattresses and emptied them on the floor as they suffocated in 


195 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


storms of cotton. Although Aureliano was just as ferocious a lover as his rival, it was Amaranta 
Ursula who ruled in that paradise of disaster with her mad genius and her lyrical voracity, as if she 
had concentrated in her love the unconquerable energy that her great-great-grandmother had given 
to the making of little candy animals. And yet, while she was singing with pleasure and dying with 
laughter over her own inventions, Aureliano was becoming more and more absorbed and silent, for 
his passion was self-centered and burning. Nevertheless, they both reached such extremes of 
virtuosity that when they became exhausted from excitement, they would take advantage of their 
fatigue. They would give themselves over to the worship of their bodies, discovering that the rest 
periods of love had unexplored possibilities, much richer than those of desire. While he would rub 
Amaranta Ursula’s erect breasts with egg whites or smooth her elastic thighs and peach-like stomach 
with cocoa butter, she would play with Aureliano’s portentous creature as if it were a doll and would 
paint clown’s eyes on it with her lipstick and give it a Turk’s mustache with her eyebrow pencil, and 
would put on organza bow ties and little tinfoil hats. One night they daubed themselves from head 
to toe with peach jam and licked each other like dogs and made mad love on the floor of the porch, 
and they were awakened by a torrent of carnivorous ants who were ready to eat them alive. 

During the pauses in their delirium, Amaranta Ursula would answer Gaston’s letters. She felt him 
to be so far away and busy that his return seemed impossible to her. In one of his first letters he told 
her that his Partners had actually sent the airplane, but that a shipping agent in Bmssels had sent it 
by mistake to Tanganyika, where it was delivered to the scattered tribe of the Makondos. That mix- 
up brought on so many difficulties that just to get the plane back might take two years. So Amaranta 
Ursula dismissed the possibility of an inopportune return. Aureliano, for his part, had no other 
contact with the world except for the letters from the wise Catalonian and the news he had of 
Gabriel through Mercedes, the silent pharmacist. At first they were real contacts. Gabriel had turned 
in his return ticket in order to stay in Paris, selling the old newspapers and empty bottles that the 
chambermaids threw out of a gloomy hotel on the Rue Dauphine. Aureliano could visualize him 
then in a turtleneck sweater which he took off only when the sidewalk Cafes on Montparnasse filled 
with springtime lovers, and sleeping by day and writing by night in order to confuse hunger in the 
room that smelled of boiled cauliflower where Rocamadour was to die. Nevertheless, news about 
him was slowly becoming so uncertain, and the letters from the wise man so sporadic and 
melancholy, that Aureliano grew to think about them as Amaranta Ursula thought about her 
husband, and both of them remained floating in an empty universe where the only everyday and 
eternal reality was love. 

Suddenly, like the stampede in that world of happy unawareness, came the news of Gaston’s 
return. Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula opened their eyes, dug deep into their souls, looked at the 
letter with their hands on their hearts, and understood that they were so close to each other that they 
preferred death to separation. Then she wrote her husband a letter of contradictory truths in which 
she repeated her love and said how anxious she was to see him again, but at the same time she 
admitted as a design of fate the impossibility of living without Aureliano. Contrary to what they had 
expected, Gaston sent them a calm, almost paternal reply, with two whole pages devoted to a 
warning against the fickleness of passion and a final paragraph with unmistakable wishes for them to 
be as happy as he had been during his brief conjugal experience. It was such an unforeseen attitude 
that Amaranta Ursula felt humiliated by the idea that she had given her husband the pretext that he 
had wanted in order to abandon her to her fate. The rancor was aggravated six months later when 
Gaston wrote again from Leopoldville, where he had finally recovered the airplane, simply to ask 
them to ship him the velocipede, which of all that he had left behind in Macondo was the only thing 
that had any sentimental value for him. Aureliano bore Amaranta Ursula’s spite patiently and made 
an effort to show her that he could be as good a husband in adversity as in prosperity, and the daily 
needs that besieged them when Gaston’s last money ran out created a bond of solidarity between 


196 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


them that was not as dazzling and heady as passion, but that let them make love as much and be as 
happy as during their uproarious and salacious days. At the time Pilar Ternera died they were 
expecting a child. 

In the lethargy of her pregnancy, Amaranta Ursula tried to set up a business in necklaces made 
out of the backbones of fish. But except for Mercedes, who bought a dozen, she could not find any 
customers. Aureiiano was aware for the first time that his gift for languages, his encyclopedic 
knowledge, his rare faculty for remembering the details of remote deeds and places without having 
been there, were as useless as the box of genuine jewelry that his wife owned, which must have been 
worth as much as all the money that the last inhabitants of Macondo could have put together. They 
survived miraculously. Although Amaranta Ursula did not lose her good humor or her genius for 
erotic mischief, she acquired the habit of sitting on the porch after lunch in a kind of wakeful and 
thoughtful siesta. Aureiiano would accompany her. Sometimes they would remain there in silence 
until nightfall, opposite each other, looking into each other’s eyes, loving each other as much as in 
their scandalous days. The uncertainty of the future made them turn their hearts toward the past. 
They saw themselves in the lost paradise of the deluge, splashing in the puddles in the courtyard, 
killing lizards to hang on Ursula, pretending that they were going to bury her alive, and those 
memories revealed to them the truth that they had been happy together ever since they had had 
memory. Going deeper into the past, Amaranta Ursula remembered the afternoon on which she had 
gone into the silver shop and her mother told her that little Aureiiano was nobody’s child because he 
had been found floating in a basket. Although the version seemed unlikely to them, they did not 
have any information enabling them to replace it with the true one. All that they were sure of after 
examining an the possibilities was that Fernanda was not Aureliano’s mother. Amaranta Ursula was 
inclined to believe that he was the son of Petra Cotes, of whom she remembered only tales of 
infamy, and that supposition produced a twinge of horror in her heart. 

Tormented by the certainty that he was Iris wife’s brother, Aureiiano ran out to the parish house 
to search through the moldy and moth-eaten archives for some clue to his parentage. The oldest 
baptismal certificate that he found was that of Amaranta Buendfa, baptized in adolescence by Father 
Nicanor Reyna during the time when he was trying to prove the existence of God by means of tricks 
with chocolate. He began to have that feeling that he was one of the seventeen Aurelianos, whose 
birth certificates he tracked down as he went through four volumes, but the baptism dates were too 
far back for his age. Seeing him lost in the labyrinths of kinship, trembling with uncertainty, the arth¬ 
ritic priest, who was watching him from his hammock, asked him compassionately what his name 
was. 

“Aureiiano Buendfa,” he said. 

“Then don’t wear yourself out searching,” the priest exclaimed with final conviction. “Many years 
ago there used to be a street here with that name and in those days people had the custom of 
naming their children after streets.” 

Aureiiano trembled with rage. 

“So!” he said. “You don’t believe it either.” 

“Believe what?” 

“That Colonel Aureiiano, Buendfa fought thirty-two civil wars and lost them all,” Aureiiano 
answered. “That the army hemmed in and machine-gunned three thousand workers and that their 
bodies were carried off to be thrown into the sea on a train with two hundred cars.” 

The priest measured him with a pitying look. 

“Oh, my son,” he signed. “It’s enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.” 

So Aureiiano and Amaranta Ursula accepted the version of the basket, not because they believed 
it, but because it spared them their terror. As the pregnancy advanced they were becoming a single 
being, they were becoming more and more integrated in the solitude of a house that needed only 


197 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


one last breath to be knocked down. They restricted themselves to an essential area, from 
Fernanda’s bedroom, where the charms of sedentary love were visible, to the beginning of the 
porch, where Amaranta Ursula would sit to sew bootees and bonnets for the newborn baby and 
Aureliano, would answer the occasional letters from the wise Catalonian. The rest of the house was 
given over to the tenacious assault of destmction. The silver shop, Melquiades’ room, the primitive 
and silent realm of Santa Sofia de la Piedad remained in the depths of a domestic jungle that no one 
would have had the courage to penetrate. Surrounded by the voracity of nature, Aureliano and 
Amaranta Ursula continued cultivating the oregano and the begonias and defended their world with 
demarcations of quicklime, building the last trenches in the age-old war between man and ant. Her 
long and neglected hair, the splotches that were beginning to appear on her face, the swelling of her 
legs, the deformation of her former lovemaking weasel’s body had changed Amaranta Ursula from 
the youthful creature she had been when she arrived at the house with the cage of luckless canaries 
and her captive husband, but it did not change the vivacity of her spirit. “Shit,” she would say, 
laughingly. “Who would have thought that we really would end up living like cannibals!” The last 
thread that joined them to the world was broken on the sixth month of pregnancy when they 
received a letter that obviously was not from the wise Catalonian. It had been mailed in Barcelona, 
but the envelope was addressed in conventional blue ink by an official hand and it had the innocent 
and impersonal look of hostile messages. Aureliano snatched it out of Amaranta Ursula’s hands as 
she was about to open it. 

“Not this one,” he told her. “I don’t want to know what it says.” 

Just as he had sensed, the wise Catalonian did not write again. The stranger’s letter, which no one 
read, was left to the mercy of the moths on the shelf where Fernanda had forgotten her wedding 
ring on occasion and there it remained, consuming itself in the inner fire of its bad news as the 
solitary lovers sailed against the tide of those days of the last stages, those impenitent and ill-fated 
times which were squandered on the useless effort of making them drift toward the desert of 
disenchantment and oblivion. Aware of that menace, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula spent the hot 
months holding hands, ending with the love of loyalty for the child who had his beginning in the 
madness of fornication. At night, holding each other in bed, they were not frightened by the 
sublunary explosions of the ants or the noise of the moths or the constant and clean whistle of the 
growth of the weeds in the neighboring rooms. Many times they were awakened by the traffic of the 
dead. They could hear Ursula fighting against the laws of creation to maintain the line, and Jose 
Arcadio Buendia searching for the mythical truth of the great inventions, and Fernanda praying, and 
Colonel Aureliano Buendia stupefying himself with the deception of war and the little gold fishes, 
and Aureliano Segundo dying of solitude in the turmoil of his debauches, and then they learned that 
dominant obsessions can prevail against death and they were happy again with the certainty that they 
would go on loving each other in their shape as apparitions long after other species of future animals 
would steal from the insects the paradise of misery that the insects were finally stealing from man. 

One Sunday, at six in the afternoon, Amaranta Ursula felt the pangs of childbirth. The smiling 
mistress of the little girls who went to bed because of hunger had her get onto the dining-room 
table, straddled her stomach, and mistreated her with wild gallops until her cries were drowned out 
by the bellows of a formidable male child. Through her tears Amaranta Ursula could see that he was 
one of those great Buendias, strong and willful like the Jose Arcadios, with the open and clairvoyant 
eyes of the Aurelianos, and predisposed to begin the race again from the beginning and cleanse it of 
its pernicious vices and solitary calling, for he was the only one in a century who had been 
engendered with love. 

“He’s a real cannibal.” she said. “We’ll name him Rodrigo.” 

“No,” her husband countered. “We’ll name him Aureliano and he’ll win thirty-two wars.”

After cutting the umbilical cord, the midwife began to use a cloth to take off the blue grease that 
covered his body as Aureliano held up a lamp. Only when they turned him on his stomach did they 
see that he had something more than other men, and they leaned over to examine him. It was the 
tail of a pig. 

They were not alarmed. Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula were not aware of the family precedent, 
nor did they remember Ursula’s frightening admonitions, and the midwife pacified them with the 
idea that the tail could be cut off when the child got his second teeth. Then they had no time to 
think about it again, because Amaranta Ursula was bleeding in an uncontainable torrent. They tried 
to help her with applications of spider webs and balls of ash, but it was like trying to hold back a 
spring with one’s hands. During the first hours she tried to maintain her good humor. She took the 
frightened Aureliano by the hand and begged him not to worry, because people like her were not 
made to die against their will, and she exploded with laughter at the ferocious remedies of the 
midwife. But as Aureliano’s hope abandoned him she was becoming less visible, as if the light on her 
were fading away, until she sank into drowsiness. At dawn on Monday they brought a woman who 
recited cauterizing prayers that were infallible for man and beast beside her bed, but Amaranta 
Ursula’s passionate blood was insensible to any artifice that did not come from love. In the after¬ 
noon, after twenty-four hours of desperation, they knew that she was dead because the flow had 
stopped without remedies and her profile became sharp and the blotches on her face evaporated in a 
halo of alabaster and she smiled again. 

Aureliano did not understand until then how much he loved his friends, how much he missed 
them, and how much he would have given to be with them at that moment. He put the child in the 
basket that his mother had prepared for him, covered the face of the corpse with a blanket, and 
wandered aimlessly through the town, searching for an entrance that went back to the past. He 
knocked at the door of the pharmacy, where he had not visited lately, and he found a carpenter 
shop. The old woman who opened the door with a lamp in her hand took pity on his delirium and 
insisted that, no, there had never been a pharmacy there, nor had she ever known a woman with a 
thin neck and sleepy eyes named Mercedes. He wept, leaning his brow against the door of the wise 
Catalonian’s former bookstore, conscious that he was paying with his tardy sobs for a death that he 
had refused to weep for on time so as not to break the spell of love. He smashed his fists against the 
cement wall of The Golden Child, calling for Pilar Ternera, indifferent to the luminous orange disks 
that were crossing the sky and that so many times on holiday nights he had contemplated with 
childish fascination from the courtyard of the curlews. In the last open salon of the tumbledown 
red-light district an accordion group was playing the songs of Rafael Escalona, the bishop’s nephew, 
heir to the secrets of Francisco the Man. The bartender, who had a withered and somewhat 
crumpled arm because he had raised it against his mother, invited Aureliano to have a bottle of cane 
liquor, and Aureliano then bought him one. The bartender spoke to him about the misfortune of his 
arm. Aureliano spoke to him about the misfortune of his heart, withered and somewhat crumpled 
for having been raised against his sister. They ended up weeping together and Aureliano felt for a 
moment that the pain was over. But when he was alone again in the last dawn of Macondo, he 
opened up his arms in the middle of the square, ready to wake up the whole world, and he shouted 
with all his might: 

“Friends are a bunch of bastards!” 

Nigromanta rescued him from a pool of vomit and tears. She took him to her room, cleaned him 
up, made him drink a cup of broth. Thinking that it would console him, she took a piece of charcoal 
and erased the innumerable loves that he still owed her for, and she voluntarily brought up her own 
most solitary sadnesses so as not to leave him alone in his weeping. When he awoke, after a dull and 
brief sleep, Aureliano recovered the awareness of his headache. He opened his eyes and remembered 
the child. 


199 



GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUES x ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE 


He could not find the basket. At first he felt an outburst of joy, thinking that Amaranta Ursula 
had awakened from death to take care of the child. But her corpse was a pile of stones under the 
blanket. Aware that when he arrived he had found the -door to the bedroom open, Aureliano went 
across the porch which was saturated with the morning sighs of oregano and looked into the dining 
room, where the remnants of the birth still lay: the large pot, the bloody sheets, the jars of ashes, and 
the twisted umbilical cord of the child on an opened diaper on the table next to the shears and the 
fishline. The idea that the midwife had returned for the child during the night gave him a pause of 
rest in which to think. He sank into the rocking chair, the same one in which Rebeca had sat during 
the early days of the house to give embroidery lessons, and in which Amaranta had played Chinese 
checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, and in which Amaranta Ursula had sewn the tiny 
clothing for the child, and in that flash of lucidity he became aware that he was unable to bear in his 
soul the crushing weight of so much past. Wounded by the fatal lances of his own nostalgia and that 
of others, he admired the persistence of the spider webs on the dead rose bushes, the perseverance 
of the rye grass, the patience of the air in the radiant February dawn. And then he saw the child. It 
was a dry and bloated bag of skin that all the ants in the world were dragging toward their holes 
along the stone path in the garden. Aureliano could not move. Not because he was paralyzed by 
horror but because at that prodigious instant Melqufades’ final keys were revealed to him and he saw 
the epigraph of the parchments perfectly placed in the order of man’s time and space: The first of the 
line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by the ants. 

Aureliano, had never been more lucid in any act of his life as when he forgot about his dead ones 
and the pain of his dead ones and nailed up the doors and windows again with Fernanda’s crossed 
boards so as not to be disturbed by any temptations of the world, for he knew then that his fate was 
written in Melqufades’ parchments. He found them intact among the prehistoric plants and steaming 
puddles and luminous insects that had removed all trace of man’s passage on earth from the room, 
and he did not have the calmness to bring them out into the light, but right there, standing, without 
the slightest difficulty, as if they had been written in Spanish and were being read under the dazzling 
splendor of high noon, he began to decipher them aloud. It was the history of the family, written by 
Melqufades, down to the most trivial details, one hundred years ahead of time. He had written it in 
Sanskrit, which was his mother tongue, and he had encoded the even lines in the private cipher of 
the Emperor Augustus and the odd ones in a Lacedemonian military code. The final protection, 
which Aureliano had begun to glimpse when he let himself be confused by the love of Amaranta 
Ursula, was based on the fact that Melqufades had not put events in the order of man’s conventional 
time, but had concentrated a century of daily episodes in such a way that they coexisted in one 
instant. Fascinated by the discovery, Aureliano, read aloud without skipping the chanted encyclicals 
that Melqufades himself had made Arcadio listen to and that were in reality the prediction of his 
execution, and he found the announcement of the birth of the most beautiful woman in the world 
who was rising up to heaven in body and soul, and he found the origin of the posthumous twins 
who gave up deciphering the parchments, not simply through incapacity and lack of drive, but also 
because their attempts were premature. At that point, impatient to know his own origin, Aureliano 
skipped ahead. Then the wind began, warm, incipient, full of voices from the past, the murmurs of 
ancient geraniums, sighs of disenchantment that preceded the most tenacious nostalgia. He did not 
notice it because at that moment he was discovering the first indications of his own being in a 
lascivious grandfather who let himself be frivolously dragged along across a hallucinated plateau in 
search of a beautiful woman who would not make him happy. Aureliano recognized him, he pursued 
the hidden paths of his descent, and he found the instant of his own conception among the 
scorpions and the yellow butterflies in a sunset bathroom where a mechanic satisfied Iris lust on a 
woman who was giving herself out of rebellion. He was so absorbed that he did not feel the second 
surge of wind either as its cyclonic strength tore the doors and windows off their hinges, pulled off

the roof of the east wing, and uprooted the foundations. Only then did he discover that Amaranta 
Ursula was not his sister but his aunt, and that Sir Francis Drake had attacked Riohacha only so that 
they could seek each other through the most intricate labyrinths of blood until they would engender 
the mythological animal that was to bring the line to an end. Macondo was already a fearful 
whirlwind of dust and mbble being spun about by the wrath of the biblical hurricane when 
Aureliano skipped eleven pages so as not to lose time with facts he knew only too well, and he 
began to decipher the instant that he was living, deciphering it as he lived it, prophesying himself in 
the act of deciphering the last page of the parchments, as if he were looking into a speaking mirror. 
Then he skipped again to anticipate the predictions and ascertain the date and circumstances of his 
death. Before reaching the final line, however, he had already understood that he would never leave 
that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind 
and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish 
deciphering the parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time 
immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not 
have a second opportunity on earth. 


THE END.
