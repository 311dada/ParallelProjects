# Beyond that, this file consists of a series of test cases. Each test case consists of
# 2 or 3 lines:
#
#  1. A UTF-8 string
#  2. A status
#      VALID      : The string is a valid UTF-8 representation of valid Unicode
#      INCOMPLETE : The string has a partial character at the end
#      NOTUNICODE : The string is valid UTF-8, but the characters represented
#                   are not valid unicode (
#      OVERLONG   : The string includes overlong sequences
#      MALFORMED  : The string is not valid UTF-8
# 3. If the status is VALID or NOTUNICODE, the UCS-4 representation of the string,
#    as a series of hex numbers.

# 1  Some correct UTF-8 text
